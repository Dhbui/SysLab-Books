 a yong man called melibeus
  myghty and riche
  bigat upon his wyf
  that called was prudence
  
   a doghter which that called was sophie
  
   upon a day bifel that he for his desport is went into the feeldes hym to pleye
  
   his wyf and eek his doghter hath he left inwith his hous
  of which the dores weren faste yshette
  
  970 thre of his olde foes han it espyed
  and setten laddres to the walles of his hous
  
  970a and by wyndowes been entred
  
   and betten his wyf
  and wounded his doghter with fyve mortal woundes in fyve sondry places    
   this is to seyn
  in hir feet
  in hire handes
  in hir erys
  in hir nose
  
   and in hire mouth    and leften hire for deed
  and wenten awey
  
   whan melibeus retourned was into his hous
  and saugh al this meschief
  he
  
   lyk a mad man rentynge his clothes
  gan to wepe and crie
  
   prudence
  his wyf
  as ferforth as she dorste
  bisoghte hym of his wepyng for to stynte
  
   but nat forthy he gan to crie and wepen evere lenger the moore
  
   this noble wyf prudence remembred hire upon the sentence of ovide
  in his book 
   that cleped is the remedie of love
  where as he seith
  
   
 he is a fool that destourbeth the mooder to wepen in the deeth of hire child 
   til she have wept hir fille as for a certein tyme
  
   and thanne shal man doon his diligence with amyable wordes hire to reconforte
  
   and preyen hire of hir wepyng for to stynte
 
  
   for which resoun this noble wyf prudence suffred hir housbonde 
   for to wepe and crie as for a certein space
  
  980 and whan she saugh hir tyme
  she seyde hym in this wise
  
  980a 
 allas
  my lord
 
  quod she
  
 why make ye youreself for to be lyk a fool
  
   for sothe it aperteneth nat to a wys man to maken swich a sorwe
  
   youre doghter
  with the grace of god
  shal warisshe and escape
  
   and
  al were it so that she right now were deed
  
   ye ne oughte nat
  as for hir deeth
  youreself to destroye
  
   senek seith
   the wise man shal nat take to greet disconfort for the deeth of his children
  
   but
  certes
  he sholde suffren it in pacience 
   as wel as he abideth the deeth of his owene propre persone
  
  
   this melibeus answerde anon and seyde
  
 what man
 
  quod he
  
 sholde of his wepyng stente 
   that hath so greet a cause for to wepe
  
   jhesu crist
  oure lord
  hymself wepte for the deeth of lazarus hys freend
 
  
   prudence answerde
  
 certes
  wel i woot attempree wepyng is no thyng deffended to hym that sorweful is
  
   amonges folk in sorwe
  but it is rather graunted hym to wepe
  
   the apostle paul unto the romayns writeth
   man shal rejoyse 
   with hem that maken joye and wepen with swich folk as wepen
   
  990 but though attempree wepyng be ygraunted
  outrageous wepyng certes is deffended
  
   mesure of wepyng sholde be considered after the loore that techeth us senek
  
    whan that thy frend is deed
   quod he
   lat nat thyne eyen to moyste been of teeris
  
   ne to muche drye
  although the teeris come to thyne eyen
  lat hem nat falle
  
   and whan thou hast forgoon thy freend
  do diligence to gete another freend
  
   and this is moore wysdom than for to wepe for thy freend 
   which that thou hast lorn
  for therinne is no boote
   
   and therfore
  if ye governe yow by sapience
  put awey sorwe out of youre herte
  
   remembre yow that jhesus syrak seith
   a man that is joyous and glad in herte
  
   it hym conserveth florissynge in his age
  but soothly sorweful herte maketh his bones drye
   
   he seith eek thus
  that sorwe in herte sleeth ful many a man
  
   salomon seith that right as motthes in the shepes flees anoyeth to the clothes
  
   and the smale wormes to the tree
  right so anoyeth sorwe to the herte
  
   wherfore us oghte
  as wel in the deeth of oure children 
   as in the los of oure othere goodes temporels
  have pacience
  
   remembre yow upon the pacient job
  whan he hadde lost his children and his temporeel substance
  
   and in his body endured and receyved ful many a grevous tribulacion
  yet seyde he thus
  
  1000  oure lord hath yeve it me
  oure lord hath biraft it me
  right as oure lord hath wold
  
  1000a right so it is doon
  blessed be the name of oure lord
  
  
   to thise forseide thynges answerde melibeus unto his wyf prudence
  
 alle thy wordes
 
  quod he
  
   
 been sothe and therto profitable
  but trewely myn herte is troubled with this sorwe 
   so grevously that i noot what to doone
 
  
   
 lat calle
 
  quod prudence
  
 thy trewe freendes alle and thy lynage whiche that been wise
  telleth youre cas
  
   and herkneth what they seye in conseillyng
  and yow governe after hire sentence
  
   salomon seith
   werk alle thy thynges by conseil
  and thou shalt never repente
  
  
   thanne
  by the conseil of his wyf prudence
  this melibeus leet callen a greet congregacion of folk
  
   as surgiens
  phisiciens
  olde folk and yonge
  and somme of his olde enemys reconsiled 
   as by hir semblaunt to his love and into his grace
  
   and therwithal ther coomen somme of his neighebores that diden hym reverence 
   moore for drede than for love
  as it happeth ofte
  
   ther coomen also ful many subtille flatereres and wise advocatz lerned in the lawe
  
   and whan this folk togidre assembled weren
  this melibeus in sorweful wise shewed hem his cas
  
   and by the manere of his speche it semed that in herte he baar a crueel ire
  
   redy to doon vengeaunce upon his foes
  and sodeynly desired that the werre sholde bigynne
  
  1010 but nathelees
  yet axed he hire conseil upon this matiere
  
   a surgien
  by licence and assent of swiche as weren wise
  up roos 
   and to melibeus seyde as ye may heere
  
   
 sire
 
  quod he
  
 as to us surgiens aperteneth that we do to every wight the beste that we kan
  
   where as we been withholde
  and to oure pacientz that we do no damage
  
   wherfore it happeth many tyme and ofte that whan twey men han everich wounded oother
  
   oon same surgien heeleth hem bothe
  
   wherfore unto oure art it is nat pertinent to norice werre ne parties to supporte
  
   but certes
  as to the warisshynge of youre doghter
  al be it so that she perilously be wounded
  
   we shullen do so ententif bisynesse fro day to nyght that with the grace of god 
   she shal be hool and sound as soone as is possible
 
  
   almoost right in the same wise the phisiciens answerden
  save that they seyden a fewe woordes moore
  
   that right as maladies been cured by hir contraries
  right so shul men warisshe werre by vengeaunce
  
   his neighebores ful of envye
  his feyned freendes that semeden reconsiled
  and his flatereres 
   maden semblant of wepyng
  and empeireden and agreggeden muchel of this matiere 
   in preisynge greetly melibee of myght
  of power
  of richesse
  and of freendes
  despisynge the power of his adversaries
  
  1020 and seiden outrely that he anon sholde wreken hym on his foes and bigynne werre
  
   up roos thanne an advocat that was wys
  
   by leve and by conseil of othere that were wise
  and seide
  
   
 lordynges
  the nede for which we been assembled in this place 
   is a ful hevy thyng and an heigh matiere
  
   by cause of the wrong and of the wikkednesse that hath be doon
  
   and eek by resoun of the grete damages that in tyme comynge 
   been possible to fallen for this same cause
  
   and eek by resoun of the grete richesse and power of the parties bothe
  
   for the whiche resouns it were a ful greet peril to erren in this matiere
  
   wherfore
  melibeus
  this is oure sentence
  we conseille yow aboven alle thyng that right anon thou do thy diligence 
   in kepynge of thy propre persone in swich a wise 
   that thou ne wante noon espie ne wacche thy persone for to save
  
   and after that
  we conseille that in thyn hous thou sette sufficeant garnisoun 
   so that they may as wel thy body as thyn hous defende
  
   but certes
  for to moeve werre
  ne sodeynly for to doon vengeaunce
  we may nat demen 
   in so litel tyme that it were profitable
  
   wherfore we axen leyser and espace to have deliberacion in this cas to deme
  
  1030 for the commune proverbe seith thus
   he that soone deemeth
  soone shal repente
   
   and eek men seyn that thilke juge is wys that soone understondeth a matiere and juggeth by leyser
  
   for al be it so that alle tariyng be anoyful
  
   algates it is nat to repreve in yevynge of juggement ne in vengeance takyng
  
   whan it is sufficeant and resonable
  
   and that shewed oure lord jhesu crist by ensample
  for whan that the womman that was taken in avowtrie 
   was broght in his presence to knowen what sholde be doon with hire persone
  al be it so that he wiste wel hymself what 
   that he wolde answere
  yet ne wolde he nat answere sodeynly
  
   but he wolde have deliberacion
  and in the ground he wroot twies
  
   and by thise causes we axen deliberacioun
  and we shal thanne
  by the grace of god
  conseille thee 
   thyng that shal be profitable
 
  
   up stirten thanne the yonge folk atones
  and the mooste partie of that compaignye han scorned this olde wise 
   man
  and bigonnen to make noyse
  and seyden that 
   right so as whil that iren is hoot men sholden smyte
  
   right so men sholde wreken hir wronges whil that they been fresshe and newe
  
   and with loud voys they criden 
 werre
  werre
 
  
   up roos tho oon of thise olde wise
  and with his hand made contenaunce that 
   men sholde holden hem stille and yeven hym audience
  
   
 lordynges
 
  quod he
  
 ther is ful many a man that crieth  werre
  werre
   
   that woot ful litel what werre amounteth
  
   werre at his bigynnyng hath so greet an entryng and so large that every wight may entre 
   whan hym liketh and lightly fynde werre
  
  1040 but certes what ende that shal therof bifalle
  it is nat light to knowe
  
   for soothly
  whan that werre is ones bigonne
  ther is ful many a child unborn of his mooder 
   that shal sterve yong by cause of thilke werre
  or elles lyve in sorwe and dye in wrecchednesse
  
   and therfore
  er that any werre bigynne
  men moste have greet conseil and greet deliberacion
 
  
   and whan this olde man wende to enforcen his tale by resons
  wel ny alle atones bigonne they 
   to rise for to breken his tale
  and beden hym ful ofte his wordes for to abregge
  
   for soothly
  he that precheth to hem that listen nat heeren his wordes
  his sermon hem anoieth
  
   for jhesus syrak seith that 
 musik in wepynge is a noyous thyng
 
  this is to seyn
  
   as muche availleth to speken bifore folk to which his speche anoyeth 
   as it is to synge biforn hym that wepeth
  
   and whan this wise man saugh that hym wanted audience
  al shamefast he sette hym doun agayn
  
   for salomon seith
  
 ther as thou ne mayst have noon audience
  enforce thee nat to speke
 
  
   
 i see wel
 
  quod this wise man
  
 that the commune proverbe is sooth
  that 
    good conseil wanteth whan it is moost nede
  
  
   yet hadde this melibeus in his conseil many folk that prively in his eere conseilled hym certeyn thyng
  
   and conseilled hym the contrarie in general audience
  
  1050 whan melibeus hadde herd that the gretteste partie of his conseil weren accorded that he sholde maken werre
  
  1050a anoon he consented to hir conseillyng and fully affermed hire sentence
  
   thanne dame prudence
  whan that she saugh how that hir housbonde shoop hym for to wreken hym on his 
   foes and to bigynne werre
  she in ful humble wise
  whan she saugh hir tyme
  seide to hym thise wordes
  
   
 my lord
 
  quod she
  
 i yow biseche
  as hertely as i dar and kan
  
   ne haste yow nat to faste and
  for alle gerdons
  as yeveth me audience
  
   for piers alfonce seith
   whoso that dooth to thee oother good or harm
  haste thee nat to quiten it
  
   for in this wise thy freend wole abyde and thyn enemy shal the lenger lyve in drede
   
   the proverbe seith
   he hasteth wel that wisely kan abyde
   and  in wikked haste is no profit
  
  
   this melibee answerde unto his wyf prudence
  
 i purpose nat
 
  quod he
  
 to werke by thy conseil
  
   for many causes and resouns
  for certes
  every wight wolde holde me thanne a fool
  
   this is to seyn
  if i
  for thy conseillyng
  wolde chaungen 
   thynges that been ordeyned and affermed by so manye wyse
  
   secoundely
  i seye that alle wommen been wikke
  and noon good of hem alle
  
   for  of a thousand men
   seith salomon
   i foond o good man
  but certes
  
   of alle wommen
  good womman foond i nevere
   
   and also
  certes
  if i governed me by thy conseil
  
   it sholde seme that i hadde yeve to thee over me the maistrie
  
   and god forbede that it so weere
  
   for jhesus syrak seith that  if the wyf have maistrie
  she is contrarious to hir housbonde
   
  1060 and salomon seith
   nevere in thy lyf to thy wyf
  ne to thy child
  ne to thy freend 
  1060a ne yeve no power over thyself
  for bettre it were that thy children 
  1060b aske of thy persone thynges that hem nedeth than thou see thyself 
  1060c in the handes of thy children
   
   and also if i wolde werke by thy conseillyng
  certes
  my conseil moste som tyme be secree
  
   til it were tyme that it moste be knowe
  and this ne may noght be
  
   whanne dame prudence
  ful debonairly and with greet pacience
  hadde herd al that hir housbonde liked for to seye
  
   thanne axed she of hym licence for to speke
  and seyde in this wise
  
   
 my lord
 
  quod she
  
 as to youre firste resoun
  certes it may lightly been answered
  for i seye that 
   it is no folie to chaunge conseil whan the thyng is chaunged
  
   or elles whan the thyng semeth ootherweyes than it was biforn
  
   and mooreover
  i seye that though ye han sworn and bihight to perfourne youre emprise
  and nathelees ye weyve 
   to perfourne thilke same emprise by juste cause
  men sholde nat seyn therfore that ye were a liere ne forsworn
  
   for the book seith that  the wise man maketh no lesyng whan he turneth his corage to the bettre
   
   and al be it so that youre emprise be establissed and ordeyned by greet multitude of folk
  
   yet thar ye nat accomplice thilke ordinaunce but yow like
  
   for the trouthe of thynges and the profit been rather founden in fewe folk that been wise and 
   ful of resoun than by greet multitude of folk ther every man crieth and clatereth what that hym liketh
  
   soothly swich multitude is nat honest
  
  1070 and as to the seconde resoun
  where as ye seyn that alle wommen been wikke
  
  1070a save youre grace
  certes ye despisen alle wommen in this wyse
  and 
  1070b  he that al despiseth
  al displeseth
   as seith the book
  
   and senec seith that  whoso wole have sapience shal no man dispreyse
  
   but he shal gladly techen the science that he kan withouten presumpcion or pride
  
   and swiche thynges as he noght ne kan
  he shal nat been ashamed to lerne hem
  
   and enquere of lasse folk than hymself
   
   and
  sire
  that ther hath been many a good womman may lightly be preved
  
   for certes
  sire
  oure lord jhesu crist wolde nevere have descended to be born of a womman
  
   if alle wommen hadden been wikke
  
   and after that
  for the grete bountee that is in wommen
  
   oure lord jhesu crist
  whan he was risen fro deeth to lyve
  
   appeered rather to a womman than to his apostles
  
   and though that salomon seith that he ne foond nevere womman good
  
   it folweth nat therfore that alle wommen ben wikke
  
   for though that he ne foond no good womman
  certes
  
   many another man hath founden many a womman ful good and trewe
  
   or elles
  per aventure
  the entente of salomon was this
  
   that
  as in sovereyn bounte
  he foond no womman    
   this is to seyn
  that ther is no wight that hath sovereyn bountee save god allone
  
   as he hymself recordeth in hys evaungelie
  
  1080 for ther nys no creature so good that hym ne wanteth 
  1080a somwhat of the perfeccioun of god
  that is his makere
  
   youre thridde reson is this
  ye seyn that if ye governe yow by my conseil
  
   it sholde seme that ye hadde yeve me the maistrie and the lordshipe over youre persone
  
   sire
  save youre grace
  it is nat so
  for if it so were that no man sholde be conseilled 
   but oonly of hem that hadden lordshipe and maistrie of his persone
  men wolden nat be conseilled so ofte
  
   for soothly thilke man that asketh conseil of a purpos
  yet hath he free choys 
   wheither he wole werke by that conseil or noon
  
   and as to youre fourthe resoun
  ther ye seyn that the janglerie of wommen kan hyde thynges that they 
   wot noght
  as who seith that a womman kan nat hyde that she woot
  
   sire
  thise wordes been understonde of wommen that been jangleresses and wikked
  
   of whiche wommen men seyn that thre thynges dryven a man out of his hous    
   that is to seyn
  smoke
  droppyng of reyn
  and wikked wyves
  
   and of swiche wommen seith salomon that 
    it were bettre dwelle in desert than with a womman that is riotous
   
   and sire
  by youre leve
  that am nat i
  
   for ye han ful ofte assayed my grete silence and my grete pacience
  and eek how wel that 
   i kan hyde and hele thynges that men oghte secreely to hyde
  
  1090 and soothly
  as to youre fifthe resoun
  where as ye seyn that in wikked conseil wommen venquisshe men
  
  1090a god woot
  thilke resoun stant heere in no stede
  
   for understoond now
  ye asken conseil to do wikkednesse
  
   and if ye wole werken wikkednesse
  and youre wif restreyneth thilke wikked purpos
  
   and overcometh yow by reson and by good conseil
  
   certes youre wyf oghte rather to be preised than yblamed
  
   thus sholde ye understonde the philosophre that seith
   in wikked conseil wommen venquisshen hir housbondes
   
   and ther as ye blamen alle wommen and hir resouns
  i shal shewe yow by manye ensamples that 
   many a womman hath ben ful good
  and yet been
  and hir conseils ful hoolsome and profitable
  
   eek som men han seyd that the conseillynge of wommen 
   is outher to deere or elles to litel of pris
  
   but al be it so that ful many a womman is badde and hir conseil vile and noght worth
  
   yet han men founde ful many a good womman
  and ful discret and wis in conseillynge

   and mooreover
  whan oure lord hadde creat adam

    it is nat good to been a man alloone

   heere may ye se that if that wommen were nat goode
  and hir conseils goode and profitable
  
   oure lord god of hevene wolde nevere han wroght hem
  
   ne called hem help of man

  i shal restoore yow youre doghter hool and sound
  
   and eek i wol do to yow so muche that ye shul have honour in this cause
 
  
   whan melibee hadde herd the wordes of his wyf prudence
  he seyde thus
  
   
 i se wel that the word of salomon is sooth
  
   he seith that  wordes that been spoken discreetly by ordinaunce been honycombes
  
   for they yeven swetnesse to the soule and hoolsomnesse to the body
   
   and

  by cause of thy sweete wordes

   and thy grete trouthe
  i wol governe me by thy conseil in alle thyng
 
  
   
 now
  sire
 
  quod dame prudence
  
 and syn ye vouche sauf to been governed by my conseil
  
   i wol enforme yow how ye shul governe yourself in chesynge of youre conseillours
  
   ye shul first in alle youre werkes mekely biseken to the heighe god that he wol be youre conseillour
  
   and shapeth yow to swich entente that he yeve yow conseil and confort
  as taughte thobie his sone
  
    at alle tymes thou shalt blesse god
  and praye hym to dresse thy weyes

  1120 and afterward thanne shul ye taken conseil in youreself
  
  1120a and examyne wel youre thoghtes of swich thyng as yow thynketh that is best for youre profit
  
   and thanne shul ye dryve fro youre herte thre thynges that been contrariouse to good conseil
  
   that is to seyn
  ire
  coveitise
  and hastifnesse
  
   
 first
  he that axeth conseil of hymself
  certes he moste been withouten ire
  for manye causes
  
   the firste is this
  he that hath greet ire and wratthe in hymself
  he weneth alwey that 
   he may do thyng that he may nat do
  
   and secoundely
  he that is irous and wrooth
  he ne may nat wel deme
  
   and he that may nat wel deme
  may nat wel conseille
  
   the thridde is this
  that he that is irous and wrooth
  as seith senec
  
   ne may nat speke but blameful thynges
  
   and with his viciouse wordes he stireth oother folk to angre and to ire
  
   and eek
  sire
  ye moste dryve coveitise out of youre herte
  
  1130 for the apostle seith that coveitise is roote of alle harmes
  
   and trust wel that a coveitous man ne kan noght deme ne thynke
  
   but oonly to fulfille the ende of his coveitise
  
   and certes
  that ne may nevere been accompliced
  
   for evere the moore habundaunce that he hath of richesse
  the moore he desireth
  
   and
  sire
  ye moste also dryve out of youre herte hastifnesse
  for certes
  
   ye ne may nat deeme for the beste by a sodeyn thought that falleth in youre herte
  
   but ye moste avyse yow on it ful ofte
  
   for
  as ye herde her biforn
  the commune proverbe is this
  that  he that soone deemeth
  soone repenteth
   
   sire
  ye ne be nat alwey in lyk disposicioun
  
   for certes
  somthyng that somtyme semeth to yow that it is good for to do
  
   another tyme it semeth to yow the contrarie
  
   
 whan ye han taken conseil in youreself and han deemed by good deliberacion swich thyng as you semeth best
  
   thanne rede i yow that ye kepe it secree
  
  1140 biwrey nat youre conseil to no persone
  but if so be that ye wenen sikerly that 
  1140a thurgh youre biwreyyng youre condicioun shal be to yow the moore profitable
  
   for jhesus syrak seith
   neither to thy foo ne to thy frend discovere nat thy secree ne thy folie
  
   for they wol yeve yow audience and lookynge and supportacioun in thy presence and scorne thee in thyn absence
   
   another clerk seith that  scarsly shaltou fynden any persone that may kepe conseil secrely
   
   the book seith
   whil that thou kepest thy conseil in thyn herte
  thou kepest it in thy prisoun
  
   and whan thou biwreyest thy conseil to any wight
  he holdeth thee in his snare
   
   and therfore yow is bettre to hyde youre conseil in youre herte than praye him 
   to whom ye han biwreyed youre conseil that he wole kepen it cloos and stille
  
   for seneca seith
   if so be that thou ne mayst nat thyn owene conseil hyde
  
   how darstou prayen any oother wight thy conseil secrely to kepe
   
   but nathelees
  if thou wene sikerly that the biwreiyng of thy conseil to a persone wol make 
   thy condicion to stonden in the bettre plyt
  thanne shaltou tellen hym thy conseil in this wise
  
   first thou shalt make no semblant wheither thee were levere pees or werre
  or this or that
  
   ne shewe hym nat thy wille and thyn entente
  
  1150 for trust wel that comunli thise conseillours been flatereres
  
   namely the conseillours of grete lordes
  
   for they enforcen hem alwey rather to speken plesante wordes
  enclynynge to the lordes lust
  
   than wordes that been trewe or profitable
  
   and therfore men seyn that the riche man hath seeld good conseil
  but if he have it of hymself
  
   and after that thou shalt considere thy freendes and thyne enemys
  
   and as touchynge thy freendes
  thou shalt considere which of hem been 
   moost feithful and moost wise and eldest and most approved in conseillyng
  
   and of hem shalt thou aske thy conseil
  as the caas requireth
  
   i seye that first ye shul clepe to youre conseil youre freendes that been trewe
  
   for salomon seith that  right as the herte of a man deliteth in savour that is soote
  
   right so the conseil of trewe freendes yeveth swetnesse to the soule
   
   he seith also
   ther may no thyng be likned to the trewe freend
  
  1160 for certes gold ne silver ben nat so muche worth as the goode wyl of a trewe freend
   
   and eek he seith that  a trewe freend is a strong deffense
  who so that it fyndeth
  
   certes he fyndeth a greet tresour
   
   thanne shul ye eek considere if that youre trewe freendes been discrete and wise
  
   for the book seith
   axe alwey thy conseil of hem that been wise
   
   and by this same resoun shul ye clepen to youre conseil of youre freendes that been of age
  
   swiche as han seyn and been expert in manye thynges and been approved in conseillynges
  
   for the book seith that  in olde men is the sapience
  and in longe tyme the prudence
   
   and tullius seith that  grete thynges ne been nat ay accompliced by strengthe
  ne by delivernesse of body
  but 
   by good conseil
  by auctoritee of persones
  and by science
  the whiche thre thynges ne been nat fieble by age
  
   but certes they enforcen and encreescen day by day
   
   and thanne shul ye kepe this for a general reule
  first shul ye clepen to youre conseil 
   a fewe of youre freendes that been especiale
  
   for salomon seith
   manye freendes have thou
  but among a thousand chese thee oon to be thy conseillour
   
   for al be it so that thou first ne telle thy conseil but to a fewe
  
   thou mayst afterward telle it to mo folk if it be nede
  
   but looke alwey that thy conseillours have thilke thre condiciouns that i have seyd bifore    
   that is to seyn
  that they be trewe
  wise
  and of oold experience
  
  1170 and werke nat alwey in every nede by oon counseillour allone
  
  1170a for somtyme bihooveth it to been conseilled by manye
  
   for salomon seith
   salvacion of thynges is where as ther been manye conseillours
   
   
 now
  sith that i have toold yow of which folk ye sholde been counseilled
  now 
   wol i teche yow which conseil ye oghte to eschewe
  
   first
  ye shul eschue the conseillyng of fooles
  for salomon seith
   taak no conseil of a fool
  
   for he ne kan noght conseille but after his owene lust and his affeccioun
   
   the book seith that  the propretee of a fool is this
  he troweth lightly harm of every wight
  
   and lightly troweth alle bountee in hymself
   
   thou shalt eek eschue the conseillyng of alle flatereres
  swiche as enforcen hem rather to preise youre persone 
   by flaterye than for to telle yow the soothfastnesse of thynges
  
   wherfore tullius seith
   amonges alle the pestilences that been in freendshipe the gretteste is flaterie
   
   and therfore is it moore nede that thou eschue and drede flatereres than any oother peple
  
   the book seith
   thou shalt rather drede and flee fro the sweete wordes of flaterynge preiseres 
   than fro the egre wordes of thy freend that seith thee thy sothes
   
   salomon seith that  the wordes of a flaterere is a snare to cacche with innocentz
   
   he seith also that  he that speketh to his freend wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce 
   setteth a net biforn his feet to cacche hym
   
  1180 and therfore seith tullius
   enclyne nat thyne eres to flatereres
  ne taak no conseil of the wordes of flaterye
   
   and caton seith
   avyse thee wel
  and eschue the wordes of swetnesse and of plesaunce
   
   and eek thou shalt eschue the conseillyng of thyne olde enemys that been reconsiled
  
   the book seith that  no wight retourneth saufly into the grace of his olde enemy
   
   and isope seith
   ne trust nat to hem to whiche thou hast had som tyme werre or enemytee
  
   ne telle hem nat thy conseil
   
   and seneca telleth the cause why
   it may nat be
   seith he
   that where greet 
   fyr hath longe tyme endured
  that ther ne dwelleth som vapour of warmnesse
   
   and therfore seith salomon
   in thyn olde foo trust nevere
   
   for sikerly
  though thyn enemy be reconsiled
  and maketh thee chiere of humylitee
  
   and lowteth to thee with his heed
  ne trust hym nevere
  
   for certes he maketh thilke feyned humilitee moore for his profit than for any love of thy persone
  
   by cause that he deemeth to have victorie over thy persone by swich feyned contenance
  
   the which victorie he myghte nat have by strif or werre
  
   and peter alfonce seith
   make no felawshipe with thyne olde enemys
  for if thou do hem bountee
  
   they wol perverten it into wikkednesse
   
  1190 and eek thou most eschue the conseillyng of hem that been thy servantz and beren thee greet reverence
  
  1190a for peraventure they seyn it moore for drede than for love
  
   and therfore seith a philosophre in this wise
  
    ther is no wight parfitly trewe to hym that he to soore dredeth
   
   and tullius seith
   ther nys no myght so greet of any emperour that longe may endure
  
   but if he have moore love of the peple than drede
   
   thou shalt also eschue the conseiling of folk that been dronkelewe
  for they ne kan no conseil hyde
  
   for salomon seith
   ther is no privetee ther as regneth dronkenesse
   
   ye shul also han in suspect the conseillyng of swich folk as 
   conseille yow o thyng prively and conseille yow the contrarie openly
  
   for cassidorie seith that  it is a manere sleighte to hyndre
  
   whan he sheweth to doon o thyng openly and werketh prively the contrarie
   
   thou shalt also have in suspect the conseillyng of wikked folk
  for the book seith
  
    the conseillyng of wikked folk is alwey ful of fraude
   
   and david seith
   blisful is that man that hath nat folwed the conseilyng of shrewes
   
   thou shalt also eschue the conseillyng of yong folk
  for hir conseil is nat rype
  
  1200 
 now
  sire
  sith i have shewed yow of which folk ye shul take youre conseil 
  1200a and of which folk ye shul folwe the conseil
  
   now wol i teche yow how ye shal examyne youre conseil
  after the doctrine of tullius
  
   in the examynynge thanne of youre conseillour ye shul considere manye thynges
  
   alderfirst thou shalt considere that in thilke thyng that thou purposest
  and upon what thyng thou wolt have conseil
  
   that verray trouthe be seyd and conserved
  this is to seyn
  telle trewely thy tale
  
   for he that seith fals may nat wel be conseilled in that cas of which he lieth
  
   and after this thou shalt considere the thynges that acorden to that thou purposest 
   for to do by thy conseillours
  if resoun accorde therto
  
   and eek if thy myght may atteine therto
  and if the moore part 
   and the bettre part of thy conseillours acorde therto
  or noon
  
   thanne shaltou considere what thyng shal folwe of that conseillyng
  
   as hate
  pees
  werre
  grace
  profit
  or damage
  and manye othere thynges
  
   and in alle thise thynges thou shalt chese the beste and weyve alle othere thynges
  
   thanne shaltow considere of what roote is engendred the matiere of thy conseil 
   and what fruyt it may conceyve and engendre
  
  1210 thou shalt eek considere alle thise causes
  fro whennes they been sprongen
  
   and whan ye han examyned youre conseil
  as i have seyd
  and which partie is the bettre 
   and moore profitable
  and han approved it by manye wise folk and olde
  
   thanne shaltou considere if thou mayst parfourne it and maken of it a good ende
  
   for certes resoun wol nat that any man sholde bigynne a thyng 
   but if he myghte parfourne it as hym oghte
  
   ne no wight sholde take upon hym so hevy a charge that he myghte nat bere it
  
   for the proverbe seith
   he that to muche embraceth
  distreyneth litel
   
   and catoun seith
   assay to do swich thyng as thou hast power to doon
  
   lest that the charge oppresse thee so soore that 
   thee bihoveth to weyve thyng that thou hast bigonne
   
   and if so be that thou be in doute wheither thou mayst parfourne a thing or noon
  
   chese rather to suffre than bigynne
  
   and piers alphonce seith
   if thou hast myght to doon a thyng of which thou most repente
  
   it is bettre 
 nay
  than 
 ye
 
   
   this is to seyn
  that thee is bettre holde thy tonge stille than for to speke
  
  1220 thanne may ye understonde by strenger resons that if thou hast power to parfourne a werk 
  1220a of which thou shalt repente
  thanne is it bettre that thou suffre than bigynne
  
   wel seyn they that defenden every wight to assaye a thyng of which he is in doute 
   wheither he may parfourne it or noon
  
   and after
  whan ye han examyned youre conseil
  as i have seyd biforn
  and knowen wel that 
   ye may parfourne youre emprise
  conferme it thanne sadly til it be at an ende
  
   
 now is it resoun and tyme that i shewe yow whanne and wherfore that 
   ye may chaunge youre counseil withouten youre repreve
  
   soothly
  a man may chaungen his purpos and his conseil if the cause cesseth
  
   or whan a newe caas bitydeth
  
   for the lawe seith that  upon thynges that newely bityden bihoveth newe conseil
   
   and senec seith
   if thy conseil is comen to the eeris of thyn enemy
  chaunge thy conseil
   
   thou mayst also chaunge thy conseil if so be that thou fynde that by errour
  
   or by oother cause
  harm or damage may bityde
  
   also if thy conseil be dishonest
  or ellis cometh of dishonest cause
  chaunge thy conseil
  
   for the lawes seyn that  alle bihestes that been dishoneste been of no value 
  
  1230 and eek if so be that it be inpossible
  or may nat goodly be parfourned or kept
  
   
 and take this for a general reule
  that every conseil that is affermed so strongly that it may nat 
   be chaunged for no condicioun that may bityde
  i seye that thilke conseil is wikked
 
  
   this melibeus
  whanne he hadde herd the doctrine of his wyf dame prudence
  answerde in this wyse
  
   
 dame
 
  quod he
  
 as yet into this tyme ye han wel and covenably taught me as in general how 
   i shal governe me in the chesynge and in the withholdynge of my conseillours
  
   but now wolde i fayn that ye wolde condescende in especial 
   and telle me how liketh yow
  or what semeth yow
  by oure conseillours 
   that we han chosen in oure present nede
 
  
   
 my lord
 
  quod she
  
 i biseke yow in al humblesse that ye wol nat wilfully replie agayn my resouns
  
   ne distempre youre herte
  thogh i speke thyng that yow displese
  
   for god woot that
  as in myn entente
  i speke it for youre beste
  
   for youre honour
  and for youre profite eke
  
   and soothly
  i hope that youre benyngnytee wol taken it in pacience
  
   trusteth me wel
 
  quod she
  
 that youre conseil as in this caas ne sholde nat
  as to speke properly
  
   be called a conseillyng
  but a mocioun or a moevyng of folye
  
  1240 in which conseil ye han erred in many a sondry wise
  
   
 first and forward
  ye han erred in th  assemblynge of youre conseillours
  
   for ye sholde first have cleped a fewe folk to youre conseil
  and after ye myghte han shewed it 
   to mo folk
  if it hadde been nede
  
   but certes
  ye han sodeynly cleped to youre conseil a greet multitude of peple
  
   ful chargeant and ful anoyous for to heere
  
   also ye han erred
  for theras ye sholden oonly have cleped to youre conseil 
   youre trewe frendes olde and wise
  
   ye han ycleped straunge folk
  yonge folk
  false flatereres
  and enemys reconsiled
  
   and folk that doon yow reverence withouten love
  
   and eek also ye have erred
  for ye han broght with yow to youre conseil ire
  coveitise
  and hastifnesse
  
   the whiche thre thinges been contrariouse to every conseil honest and profitable
  
   the whiche thre thinges ye han nat anientissed or destroyed hem
  
   neither in youreself
  ne in youre conseillours
  as yow oghte
  
   ye han erred also
  for ye han shewed to youre conseillours 
   youre talent and youre affeccioun to make werre anon and for to do vengeance
  
  1250 they han espied by youre wordes to what thyng ye been enclyned
  
   and therfore han they rather conseilled yow to youre talent than to youre profit
  
   ye han erred also
  for it semeth that yow suffiseth 
   to han been conseilled by thise conseillours oonly
  and with litel avys
  
   whereas in so greet and so heigh a nede it hadde been necessarie mo conseillours 
   and moore deliberacion to parfourne youre emprise
  
   ye han erred also
  for ye ne han nat examyned youre conseil in the forseyde manere
  
   ne in due manere
  as the caas requireth
  
   ye han erred also
  for ye han maked no division bitwixe youre conseillours    this is to seyn
  
   bitwixen youre trewe freendes and youre feyned conseillours    
   ne ye han nat knowe the wil of youre trewe freendes olde and wise
  
   but ye han cast alle hire wordes in an hochepot
  and enclyned youre herte to the moore part 
   and to the gretter nombre
  and there been ye condescended
  
   and sith ye woot wel that men shal alwey fynde a gretter nombre of fooles than of wise men
  
   and therfore the conseils that been at congregaciouns and multitudes of folk
  there as men take moore reward 
   to the nombre than to the sapience of persones
  
  1260 ye se wel that in swiche conseillynges fooles han the maistrie
 
  
   melibeus answerde agayn
  and seyde
  
 i graunte wel that i have erred
  
   but there as thou hast toold me heerbiforn 
   that he nys nat to blame that chaungeth his conseillours in certein caas and for certeine juste causes
  
   i am al redy to chaunge my conseillours right as thow wolt devyse
  
   the proverbe seith that  for to do synne is mannyssh
  
   but certes for to persevere longe in synne is werk of the devel
  
  
   to this sentence answered anon dame prudence

  and lat us see 
   the whiche of hem han spoken most resonably and taught yow best conseil
  
   and for as muche as that the examynacion is necessarie
  lat us bigynne at the surgiens 
   and at the phisiciens
  that first speeken in this matiere
  
   i sey yow that the surgiens and phisiciens han seyd yow in youre conseil discreetly
  as hem oughte
  
   and in hir speche seyden ful wisely that to the office of hem aperteneth to doon to every wight 
   honour and profit
  and no wight for to anoye
  
  1270 and after hir craft to doon greet diligence 
  1270a unto the cure of hem which that they han in hir governaunce

  right as they han answered wisely and discreetly
  
   right so rede i that they been heighly and sovereynly gerdoned for hir noble speche
  
   and eek for they sholde do the moore ententif bisynesse in the curacion of youre doghter deere
  
   for al be it so that they been youre freendes
  therfore shal ye nat suffren 
   that they serve yow for noght
  
   but ye oghte the rather gerdone hem and shewe hem youre largesse
  
   and as touchynge the proposicioun which that the phisiciens encreesceden in this caas    this is to seyn
  
   that in maladies that oon contrarie is warisshed by another contrarie    
   i wolde fayn knowe hou ye understonde thilke text

 certes
 
  quod melibeus
  
 i understonde it in this wise
  
  1280 that right as they han doon me a contrarie
  right so sholde i doon hem another
  
   for right as they han venged hem on me and doon me wrong
  
   right so shal i venge me upon hem and doon hem wrong
  
   and thanne have i cured oon contrarie by another

  quod dame prudence
  
 how lightly is every man enclined to his owene desir 
   and to his owene plesaunce
  
   certes
 
  quod she
  
 the wordes of the phisiciens ne sholde nat han been understonden in thys wise
  
   for certes
  wikkednesse is nat contrarie to wikkednesse
  ne vengeance to vengeaunce
  
   ne wrong to wrong
  but they been semblable
  
   and therfore o vengeaunce is nat warisshed by another vengeaunce
  ne o wroong by another wroong
  
   but everich of hem encreesceth and aggreggeth oother
  
   but certes
  the wordes of the phisiciens sholde been understonden in this wise
  
   for good and wikkednesse been two contraries
  and pees and werre
  vengeaunce 
   and suffraunce
  discord and accord
  and manye othere thynges
  
  1290 but certes
  wikkednesse shal be warisshed by goodnesse
  discord by accord
  werre by pees
  
  1290a and so forth of othere thynges
  
   and heerto accordeth seint paul the apostle in manye places

   but do wel to hym that dooth thee harm and blesse hym that seith to thee harm
   
   and in manye othere places he amonesteth pees and accord
  
   but now wol i speke to yow of the conseil which that was yeven to yow 
   by the men of lawe and the wise folk
  
   that seyden alle by oon accord
  as ye han herd bifore
  
   that over alle thynges ye shal doon youre diligence to kepen youre persone and to warnestoore youre hous

   for certes
  in this world ther is no wight that may be conseilled ne kept sufficeantly

   to this sentence accordeth the prophete david
  that seith
  
    if god ne kepe the citee
  in ydel waketh he that it kepeth
   
   now

  thanne shul ye committe the kepyng of youre persone

   the book seith that  somme folk han greet lust to deceyve
  but yet they dreden hem to be deceyved
   
   yet shaltou drede to been empoisoned and kepe the from the compaignye of scorneres
  
  1330 for the book seith
   with scorneres make no compaignye
  but flee hire wordes as venym
   
   
 now
  as to the seconde point
  
   where as youre wise conseillours conseilled yow to warnestoore youre hous with gret diligence
  
   i wolde fayn knowe how that ye understonde thilke wordes and what is youre sentence
 
  
   melibeus answerde and seyde
  
 certes
  i understande it in this wise
  that i shal warnestoore myn hous with toures
  
   swiche as han castelles and othere manere edifices
  and armure
  and artelries
  
   by whiche thynges i may my persone and myn hous so kepen and deffenden 
   that myne enemys shul been in drede myn hous for to approche
 
  
   to this sentence answerde anon prudence
  
 warnestooryng
 
  quod she
  
   
 of heighe toures and of grete edifices apperteyneth somtyme to pryde
  
   and eek men make heighe toures
   and grete edifices  with grete costages and with greet travaille
  
   and whan that they been accompliced
  yet be they nat worth a stree
  
   but if they be defended by trewe freendes that been olde and wise
  
   and understoond wel that the gretteste and strongeste garnysoun that a riche man may have
  
   as wel to kepen his persone as his goodes
  is 
   that he be biloved with hys subgetz and with his neighebores
  
   for thus seith tullius
  that  ther is a manere garnysoun 
   that no man may venquysse ne disconfite
  and that is 
  1340 a lord to be biloved of his citezeins and of his peple
   
   now
  sire
  as to the thridde point
  where as youre olde 
   and wise conseillours seyden that yow ne oghte nat sodeynly ne hastily proceden in this nede
  
   but that yow oghte purveyen and apparaillen yow in this caas with greet diligence and greet deliberacioun
  
   trewely
  i trowe that they seyden right wisely and right sooth
  
   for tullius seith
   in every nede
  er thou bigynne it
  apparaille thee with greet diligence
   
   thanne seye i that in vengeance takyng
  in werre
  in bataille
  and in warnestooryng
  
   er thow bigynne
  i rede that thou apparaille thee therto
  and do it with greet deliberacion
  
   for tullius seith that  longe apparaillyng biforn the bataille maketh short victorie
   
   and cassidorus seith
   the garnysoun is stronger whan it is longe tyme avysed
   
   but now lat us speken of the conseil that was accorded by youre neighebores
  
   swiche as doon yow reverence withouten love
  
  1350 youre olde enemys reconsiled
  youre flatereres
  
   that conseilled yow certeyne thynges prively
  and openly conseilleden yow the contrarie
  
   the yonge folk also
  that conseilleden yow to venge yow and make werre anon
  
   and certes
  sire
  as i have seyd biforn
  ye han greetly erred 
   to han cleped swich manere folk to youre conseil
  
   which conseillours been ynogh repreved by the resouns aforeseyd
  
   but nathelees
  lat us now descende to the special
  ye shuln first procede after the doctrine of tullius
  
   certes
  the trouthe of this matiere
  or of this conseil
  nedeth nat diligently enquere
  
   for it is wel wist whiche they been that han doon to yow this trespas and vileynye
  
   and how manye trespassours
  and in what manere 
   they han to yow doon al this wrong and al this vileynye
  
   and after this
  thanne shul ye examyne the seconde condicion which that the same tullius addeth in this matiere
  
  1360 for tullius put a thyng which that he clepeth  consentynge 
  this is to seyn
  
   who been they
  and whiche been they and how manye that consenten to thy conseil 
   in thy wilfulnesse to doon hastif vengeance
  
   and lat us considere also who been they
  and how manye been they
  
   and whiche been they that consenteden to youre adversaries
  
   and certes
  as to the firste poynt
  it is wel knowen whiche folk been 
   they that consenteden to youre hastif wilfulnesse
  
   for trewely
  alle tho that conseilleden yow to maken sodeyn werre ne been nat youre freendes
  
   lat us now considere whiche been they that ye holde so greetly youre freendes as to youre persone
  
   for al be it so that ye be myghty and riche
  certes ye ne been but allone
  
   for certes ye ne han no child but a doghter
  
   ne ye ne han bretheren
  ne cosyns germayns
  ne noon oother neigh kynrede
  
   wherfore that youre enemys for drede sholde stinte to plede with yow or to destroye youre persone
  
  1370 ye knowen also that youre richesses mooten been dispended in diverse parties
  
   and whan that every wight hath his part
  they ne wollen taken but litel reward to venge thy deeth
  
   but thyne enemys been thre
  and they han manie children
  bretheren
  cosyns
  and oother ny kynrede
  
   and though so were that thou haddest slayn of hem two or three
  yet dwellen ther ynowe 
   to wreken hir deeth and to sle thy persone
  
   and though so be that youre kynrede be moore siker and stedefast than the kyn of youre adversarie
  
   yet nathelees youre kynrede nys but a fer kynrede
  they been but litel syb to yow
  
   and the kyn of youre enemys been ny syb to hem
  
   and certes
  as in that
  hir condicioun is bet than youres
  
   thanne lat us considere also if the conseillyng of hem that conseilleden yow to taken sodeyn vengeaunce
  
   wheither it accorde to resoun
  
   and certes
  ye knowe wel  nay
   
   for
  as by right and resoun
  ther may no man taken vengeance on no wight 
   but the juge that hath the jurisdiccioun of it
  
  1380 whan it is graunted hym to take thilke vengeance hastily or attemprely
  as the lawe requireth
  
   and yet mooreover of thilke word that tullius clepeth  consentynge
   
   thou shalt considere if thy myght and thy power may consenten 
   and suffise to thy wilfulnesse and to thy conseillours
  
   and certes thou mayst wel seyn that  nay
   
   for sikerly
  as for to speke proprely
  we may do no thyng 
   but oonly swich thyng as we may doon rightfully
  
   and certes rightfully ne mowe ye take no vengeance
  as of youre propre auctoritee
  
   thanne mowe ye seen that youre power ne consenteth nat
  ne accordeth nat
  with youre wilfulnesse
  
   
 lat us now examyne the thridde point
  that tullius clepeth  consequent
   
   thou shalt understonde that the vengeance that thou purposest for to take is the consequent
  
   and therof folweth another vengeaunce
  peril
  and werre
  and othere damages withoute nombre
  
   of whiche we be nat war
  as at this tyme
  
  1390 and as touchynge the fourthe point
  that tullius clepeth  engendrynge
   
   thou shalt considere that this wrong which that is doon to thee 
   is engendred of the hate of thyne enemys
  
   and of the vengeance takynge upon that wolde engendre another vengeance
  
   and muchel sorwe and wastynge of richesses
  as i seyde
  
   
 now
  sire
  as to the point that tullius clepeth  causes
   which that is the laste point
  
   thou shalt understonde that the wrong that thou hast receyved hath certeine causes
  
   whiche that clerkes clepen oriens and efficiens
  and causa longinqua and causa propinqua
  
   this is to seyn
  the fer cause and the ny cause
  
   the fer cause is almyghty god
  that is cause of alle thynges
  
   the neer cause is thy thre enemys
  
   the cause accidental was hate
  
   the cause material been the fyve woundes of thy doghter
  
  1400 the cause formal is the manere of hir werkynge that broghten laddres and cloumben in at thy wyndowes
  
   the cause final was for to sle thy doghter
  it letted nat in as muche as in hem was
  
   but for to speken of the fer cause
  as to what ende they shul come
  or what shal finally 
   bityde of hem in this caas
  ne kan i nat deeme but by conjectynge and by supposynge
  
   for we shul suppose that they shul come to a wikked ende
  
   by cause that the book of decrees seith
   seelden
  or with greet peyne
  been causes ybroght to good ende 
   whanne they been baddely bigonne
   
   
 now
  sire
  if men wolde axe me why that god suffred men to do yow this vileynye
  
   certes
  i kan nat wel answere
  as for no soothfastnesse
  
   for th  apostle seith that  the sciences and the juggementz of oure lord god almyghty been ful depe
  
   ther may no man comprehende ne serchen hem suffisantly
   
   nathelees
  by certeyne presumpciouns and conjectynges
  i holde and bileeve 
   that god
  which that is ful of justice and of rightwisnesse
  hath suffred this bityde by juste cause resonable
  
  1410 
 thy name is melibee
  this is to seyn
   a man that drynketh hony
   
   thou hast ydronke so muchel hony of sweete temporeel richesses
  and delices and honours of this world 
   that thou art dronken and hast forgeten jhesu crist thy creatour
  
   thou ne hast nat doon to hym swich honour and reverence as thee oughte
  
   ne thou ne hast nat wel ytaken kep to the wordes of ovide
  that seith
  
    under the hony of the goodes of the body is hyd the venym that sleeth the soule
   
   and salomon seith
   if thou hast founden hony
  ete of it that suffiseth
  
   for if thou ete of it out of mesure
  thou shalt spewe  and be nedy and povre
  
   and peraventure crist hath thee in despit
  and 
   hath turned awey fro thee his face and his eeris of misericorde
  
   and also he hath suffred that thou hast been punysshed in the manere that thow hast ytrespassed
  
  1420 thou hast doon synne agayn oure lord crist
  
   for certes
  the three enemys of mankynde 
      that is to seyn
  the flessh
  the feend
  and the world    
   thou hast suffred hem entre in to thyn herte wilfully by the wyndowes of thy body
  
   and hast nat defended thyself suffisantly agayns hire assautes and hire temptaciouns
  
   so that they han wounded thy soule in fyve places
  
   this is to seyn
  the deedly synnes that been entred into thyn herte by thy fyve wittes
  
   and in the same manere oure lord crist hath woold and suffred 
   that thy three enemys been entred into thyn house by the wyndowes 
   and han ywounded thy doghter in the forseyde manere
 
  
   
 certes
 
  quod melibee
  
 i se wel that ye enforce yow muchel by wordes to overcome me in swich manere 
   that i shal nat venge me of myne enemys
  
   shewynge me the perils and the yveles that myghten falle of this vengeance
  
   but whoso wolde considere in alle vengeances the perils and yveles that myghte sewe of vengeance takynge
  
  1430 a man wolde nevere take vengeance
  and that were harm
  
   for by the vengeance takynge been the wikked men dissevered fro the goode men
  
   and they that han wyl to do wikkednesse restreyne hir wikked purpos
  
   whan they seen the punyssynge and chastisynge of the trespassours
 
  
   and yet seye i moore
  that right as a singuler persone synneth in takynge vengeance of another man
  
   right so synneth the juge if he do no vengeance of hem that it han disserved
  
   for senec seith thus
   that maister
   he seith
   is good that proveth shrewes
   
   and as cassidore seith
   a man dredeth to do outrages whan he woot and knoweth 
   that it displeseth to the juges and the sovereyns
   
   and another seith
   the juge that dredeth to do right maketh men shrewes
   
  1440 and seint paul the apostle seith in his epistle
  whan he writeth unto the romayns
  that 
  1440a  the juges beren nat the spere withouten cause
  
   but they beren it to punysse the shrewes and mysdoers and for to defende the goode men
   
   if ye wol thanne take vengeance of youre enemys
  ye shul retourne or have youre recours to the juge 
   that hath the jurisdiccion upon hem
  
   and he shal punysse hem as the lawe axeth and requireth
 
  
   
 a
 
  quod melibee
  
 this vengeance liketh me no thyng
  
   i bithenke me now and take heede how fortune hath norissed me fro my childhede 
   and hath holpen me to passe many a stroong paas
  
   now wol i assayen hire
  trowynge
  with goddes help
  that she shal helpe me my shame for to venge
 
  
   
 certes
 
  quod prudence
  
 if ye wol werke by my conseil
  ye shul nat assaye fortune by no wey
  
   ne ye shul nat lene or bowe unto hire
  after the word of senec
  
   for  thynges that been folily doon
  and that been in hope of fortune
  shullen nevere come to good ende
   
  1450 and
  as the same senec seith
   the moore cleer and the moore shynyng that fortune is
  
  1450a the moore brotil and the sonner broken she is
   
   trusteth nat in hire
  for she nys nat stidefast ne stable
  
   for whan thow trowest to be moost seur or siker of hire help
  
   she wol faille thee and deceyve thee
  
   and where as ye seyn that fortune hath norissed yow fro youre childhede
  
   i seye that in so muchel shul ye the lasse truste in hire and in hir wit
  
   for senec seith
   what man that is norissed by fortune
  she maketh hym a greet fool
   
   now thanne
  syn ye desire and axe vengeance
  and the vengeance that is doon after the lawe 
   and bifore the juge ne liketh yow nat
  
   and the vengeance that is doon in hope of fortune is perilous and uncertein
  
   thanne have ye noon oother remedie but for to have youre recours 
   unto the sovereyn juge that vengeth alle vileynyes and wronges
  
   and he shal venge yow after that hymself witnesseth
  where as he seith
  
  1460  leveth the vengeance to me
  and i shal do it
  
  
   melibee answerde
  
 if i ne venge me nat of the vileynye that men han doon to me
  
   i sompne or warne hem that han doon to me that vileynye
  
   and alle othere
  to do me another vileynye
  
   for it is writen
   if thou take no vengeance of an oold vileynye
  
   thou sompnest thyne adversaries to do thee a newe vileynye
   
   and also for my suffrance men wolden do me so muchel vileynye that 
   i myghte neither bere it ne susteene
  
   and so sholde i been put and holden overlowe
  
   for men seyn
   in muchel suffrynge shul manye thynges falle unto thee whiche thou shalt nat mowe suffre
  
  
   
 certes
 
  quod prudence
  
 i graunte yow that over muchel suffraunce is nat good
  
   but yet ne folweth it nat therof that every persone to whom men doon vileynye take of it vengeance
  
   for that aperteneth and longeth al oonly to the juges
  for they shul venge the vileynyes and injuries
  
  1470 and therfore tho two auctoritees that ye han seyd above been oonly understonden in the juges
  
   for whan they suffren over muchel the wronges and the vileynyes to be doon withouten punysshynge
  
   they sompne nat a man al oonly for to do newe wronges
  but they comanden it
  
   also a wys man seith that  the juge that correcteth nat the synnere comandeth and biddeth hym do synne
   
   and the juges and sovereyns myghten in hir land so muchel suffre of the shrewes and mysdoeres 
   that they sholden
  by swich suffrance
  by proces of tyme wexen of swich power and myght 
   that they sholden putte out the juges and the sovereyns from hir places
  
   and atte laste maken hem lesen hire lordshipes
  
   
 but lat us now putte that ye have leve to venge yow
  
   i seye ye been nat of myght and power as now to venge yow
  
   for if ye wole maken comparisoun unto the myght of youre adversaries
  ye shul fynde in manye thynges that 
   i have shewed yow er this that hire condicion is bettre than youres
  
  1480 and therfore seye i that it is good as now that ye suffre and be pacient
  
   
 forthermoore
  ye knowen wel that after the comune sawe
   it is a woodnesse a man to stryve 
   with a strenger or a moore myghty man than he is hymself
  
   and for to stryve with a man of evene strengthe    that is to seyn
  
   with as strong a man as he is    it is peril
  
   and for to stryve with a weyker man
  it is folie
   
   and therfore sholde a man flee stryvynge as muchel as he myghte
  
   for salomon seith
   it is a greet worshipe to a man to kepen hym fro noyse and stryf
   
   and if it so bifalle or happe that a man of gretter myght and strengthe 
   than thou art do thee grevaunce
  
   studie and bisye thee rather to stille the same grevaunce than for to venge thee
  
   for senec seith that  he putteth hym in greet peril 
   that stryveth with a gretter man than he is hymself
   
   and catoun seith
   if a man of hyer estaat or degree
  or moore myghty than thou
  
   do thee anoy or grevaunce
  suffre hym
  
  1490 for he that oones hath greved thee
  may another tyme releeve thee and helpe
   
   yet sette i caas ye have bothe myght and licence for to venge yow
  
   i seye that ther be ful manye thynges that shul restreyne yow of vengeance takynge 
   and make yow for to enclyne to suffre
  and for to han pacience 
   in the wronges that han been doon to yow
  
   first and foreward
  if ye wole considere the defautes that been in youre owene persone
  
   for whiche defautes god hath suffred yow have this tribulacioun
  as i have seyd yow heer biforn
  
   for the poete seith that  we oghte paciently taken the tribulacions 
   that comen to us
  whan we thynken and consideren that we han disserved to have hem
   
   and seint gregorie seith that  whan a man considereth wel the nombre of his defautes and of his synnes
  
   the peynes and the tribulaciouns that he suffreth semen the lesse unto hym
  
   and in as muche as hym thynketh his synnes moore hevy and grevous
  
  1500 in so muche semeth his peyne the lighter and the esier unto hym
   
   also ye owen to enclyne and bowe youre herte 
   to take the pacience of oure lord jhesu crist
  as seith seint peter in his epistles
  
    jhesu crist
   he seith
   hath suffred for us and yeven ensample to every man to folwe and sewe hym
  
   for he dide nevere synne
  ne nevere cam ther a vileyns word out of his mouth
  
   whan men cursed hym
  he cursed hem noght
  and whan men betten hym
  he manaced hem noght
   
   also the grete pacience which the seintes that been in paradys han had in tribulaciouns 
   that they han ysuffred
  withouten hir desert or gilt
  
   oghte muchel stiren yow to pacience
  
   forthermoore ye sholde enforce yow to have pacience
  
   considerynge that the tribulaciouns of this world but litel while endure and soone passed been and goon
  
   and the joye that a man seketh to have by pacience in tribulaciouns is perdurable
  
   after that the apostle seith in his epistle
  
  1510  the joye of god
   he seith
   is perdurable     that is to seyn
  everelastynge
  
   also troweth and bileveth stedefastly that he nys nat wel ynorissed
  ne wel ytaught
  
   that kan nat have pacience or wol nat receyve pacience
  
   for salomon seith that  the doctrine and the wit of a man is knowen by pacience
   
   and in another place he seith that  he that is pacient governeth hym by greet prudence
   
   and the same salomon seith
   the angry and wrathful man maketh noyses
  
   and the pacient man atempreth hem and stilleth
   
   he seith also
   it is moore worth to be pacient than for to be right strong
  
   and he that may have the lordshipe of his owene herte is moore to preyse than he that 
   by his force or strengthe taketh grete citees
   
   and therfore seith seint jame in his epistle that  pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun
  
  
   
 certes
 
  quod melibee
  
 i graunte yow
  dame prudence
  that pacience is a greet vertu of perfeccioun
  
   but every man may nat have the perfeccioun that ye seken
  
  1520 ne i nam nat of the nombre of right parfite men
  
   for myn herte may nevere been in pees unto the tyme it be venged
  
   and al be it so that it was greet peril to myne enemys 
   to do me a vileynye in takynge vengeance upon me
  
   yet tooken they noon heede of the peril
  but fulfilleden hir wikked wyl and hir corage
  
   and therfore me thynketh men oghten nat repreve me
  
   though i putte me in a litel peril for to venge me
  
   and though i do a greet excesse
  that is to seyn
  that i venge oon outrage by another
 
  
   
 a
 
  quod dame prudence
  
 ye seyn youre wyl and as yow liketh
  
   but in no caas of the world a man sholde nat doon outrage ne excesse for to vengen hym
  
   for cassidore seith that  as yvele dooth he that vengeth hym by outrage as he that dooth the outrage
   
   and therfore ye shul venge yow after the ordre of right
  that is to seyn
  by the lawe 
   and noght by excesse ne by outrage
  
  1530 and also
  if ye wol venge yow of the outrage of youre adversaries 
  1530a in oother manere than right comandeth
  ye synnen
  
   and therfore seith senec that  a man shal nevere vengen shrewednesse by shrewednesse
   
   and if ye seye that right axeth a man to defenden violence by violence and fightyng by fightyng
  
   certes ye seye sooth
  whan the defense is doon anon withouten intervalle or withouten tariyng or delay
  
   for to deffenden hym and nat for to vengen hym
  
   and it bihoveth that a man putte swich attemperance in his deffense 
   that men have no cause ne matiere to repreven hym that deffendeth hym of excesse and outrage
  
   for ellis were it agayn resoun
  
   pardee
  ye knowen wel that ye maken no deffense 
   as now for to deffende yow
  but for to venge yow
  
   and so seweth it that ye han no wyl to do youre dede attemprely
  
   and therfore me thynketh that pacience is good
  for salomon seith that 
    he that is nat pacient shal have greet harm
  
  
  1540 
 certes
 
  quod melibee
  
 i graunte yow that whan a man is inpacient and wrooth of that 
  1540a that toucheth hym noght and that aperteneth nat unto hym
  though it harme hym
  it is no wonder
  
   for the lawe seith that  he is coupable that entremetteth hym 
   or medleth with swych thyng as aperteneth nat unto hym
   
   and salomon seith that  he that entremetteth hym of the noyse or strif of another man 
   is lyk to hym that taketh an hound by the eris
   
   for right as he that taketh a straunge hound by the eris is outherwhile biten with the hound
  
   right in the same wise is it resoun that he have harm that by his inpacience medleth hym 
   of the noyse of another man
  wheras it aperteneth nat unto hym
  
   but ye knowen wel that this dede    that is to seyn
  
   my grief and my disese    toucheth me right ny
  
   and therfore
  though i be wrooth and inpacient
  it is no merveille
  
   and
  savynge youre grace
  i kan nat seen that it myghte greetly harme me though i tooke vengeaunce
  
   for i am richer and moore myghty than myne enemys been
  
   and wel knowen ye that by moneye and by havynge grete possessions 
   been alle the thynges of this world governed
  
  1550 and salomon seith that  alle thynges obeyen to moneye
  
  
   whan prudence hadde herd hir housbonde avanten hym of his richesse 
   and of his moneye
  dispreisynge the power of his adversaries
  
   she spak and seyde in this wise
  
   
 certes
  deere sire
  i graunte yow that ye been riche and myghty 
   and that the richesses been goode to hem that han wel ygeten hem and wel konne usen hem
  
   for right as the body of a man may nat lyven withoute the soule
  
   namoore may it lyve withouten temporeel goodes
  
   and by richesses may a man gete hym grete freendes
  
   and therfore seith pamphilles
   if a net herdes doghter
   seith he
   be riche
  
   she may chesen of a thousand men which she wol take to hir housbonde
  
   for
  of a thousand men
  oon wol nat forsaken hire ne refusen hire
   
   and this pamphilles seith also
   if thow be right happy    that is to seyn
  
   if thou be right riche    thou shalt fynde a greet nombre of felawes and freendes
  
   and if thy fortune change that thou wexe povre
  farewel freendshipe and felaweshipe
  
  1560 for thou shalt be alloone withouten any compaignye
  but if it be the compaignye of povre folk
   
   and yet seith this pamphilles moreover that  they that been thralle and bonde of lynage 
   shullen been maad worthy and noble by the richesses
   
   and right so as by richesses ther comen manye goodes
  
   right so by poverte come ther manye harmes and yveles
  
   for greet poverte constreyneth a man to do manye yveles
  
   and therfore clepeth cassidore poverte the mooder of ruyne
  
   that is to seyn
  the mooder of overthrowynge or fallynge doun
  
   and therfore seith piers alfonce
   oon of the gretteste adversitees of this world is 
   whan a free man by kynde or of burthe is constreyned by poverte 
   to eten the almesse of his enemy
   
   and the same seith innocent in oon of his bookes
  he seith that 
    sorweful and myshappy is the condicioun of a povre beggere
  
   for if he axe nat his mete
  he dyeth for hunger
  
  1570 and if he axe
  he dyeth for shame
  and algates necessitee constreyneth hym to axe
   
   and seith salomon that  bet it is to dye than for to have swich poverte
   
   and as the same salomon seith
   bettre it is to dye of bitter deeth 
   than for to lyven in swich wise
   
   by thise resons that i have seid unto yow and by manye othere resons that i koude seye
  
   i graunte yow that richesses been goode to hem that geten hem wel 
   and to hem that wel usen tho richesses
  
   and therfore wol i shewe yow hou ye shul have yow
  and how ye shul bere yow 
   in gaderynge of richesses
  and in what manere ye shul usen hem
  
   
 first
  ye shul geten hem withouten greet desir
  by good leyser
  sokyngly and nat over hastily
  
   for a man that is to desirynge to gete richesses abaundoneth hym 
   first to thefte
  and to alle othere yveles
  
   and therfore seith salomon
   he that hasteth hym to bisily to wexe riche shal be noon innocent
   
   he seith also that  the richesse that hastily cometh to a man soone 
   and lightly gooth and passeth fro a man
  
  1580 but that richesse that cometh litel and litel wexeth alwey and multiplieth
   
   and
  sire
  ye shul geten richesses by youre wit and by youre travaille unto youre profit
  
   and that withouten wrong or harm doynge to any oother persone
  
   for the lawe seith that  ther maketh no man himselven riche
  if he do harm to another wight
   
   this is to seyn
  that nature deffendeth and forbedeth by right that 
   no man make hymself riche unto the harm of another persone
  
   and tullius seith that  no sorwe
  ne no drede of deeth
  ne no thyng 
   that may falle unto a man
  is so muchel agayns 
   nature as a man to encressen his owene profit to the harm of another man
  
   and though the grete men and the myghty men geten richesses moore lightly than thou
  
   yet shaltou nat been ydel ne slow to do thy profit
  for thou shalt in alle wise flee ydelnesse
   
   for salomon seith that  ydelnesse techeth a man to do manye yveles
   
  1590 and the same salomon seith that  he that travailleth and bisieth hym to tilien his land shal eten breed
  
   but he that is ydel and casteth hym to no bisynesse 
   ne occupacioun shal falle into poverte and dye for hunger
   
   and he that is ydel and slow kan nevere fynde covenable tyme for to doon his profit
  
   for ther is a versifiour seith that  the ydel man excuseth hym in wynter by cause 
   of the grete coold
  and in somer by enchesoun of the greete heete
   
   for thise causes seith caton
   waketh and enclyneth nat yow over muchel for to slepe
  
   for over muchel reste norisseth and causeth manye vices
   
   and therfore seith seint jerome
   dooth somme goode dedes that the devel
  
   which is oure enemy
  ne fynde yow nat unocupied
   
   for the devel ne taketh nat lightly unto his werkynge swiche as he fyndeth occupied in goode werkes
  
   
 thanne thus in getynge richesses ye mosten flee ydelnesse
  
   and afterward
  ye shul use the richesses which ye have geten by youre wit and by youre travaille 
   in swich a manere that men holde yow nat to scars
  ne to sparynge
  ne to fool large 
      that is to seyen
  over large a spendere
  
  1600 for right as men blamen an avaricious man by cause of his scarsetee and chyncherie
  
   in the same wise is he to blame that spendeth over largely
  
   and therfore seith caton
   use
   he seith
   thy richesses that thou hast geten 
   in swich a manere that men have no matiere ne cause to calle thee neither wrecche ne chynche
  
   for it is a greet shame to a man to have a povere herte and a riche purs
   
   he seith also
   the goodes that thou hast ygeten
  use hem by mesure
   
   that is to seyn
  spende hem mesurably
  
   for they that folily wasten and despenden the goodes that they han
  
   whan they han namoore propre of hir owene
  they shapen hem to take the goodes of another man
  
   i seye thanne that ye shul fleen avarice
  
   usynge youre richesses in swich manere that men seye nat that youre richesses been yburyed 
  1610 but that ye have hem in youre myght and in youre weeldynge
  
   for a wys man repreveth the avaricious man
  and seith thus in two vers
  
    wherto and why burieth a man his goodes by his grete avarice
  
   and knoweth wel that nedes moste he dye
  
   for deeth is the ende of every man as in this present lyf
   
   and for what cause or enchesoun joyneth he hym or knytteth he hym so faste unto his goodes 
   that alle hise wittes mowen nat disseveren hym or departen hym from his goodes
  
   and knoweth wel
  or oghte knowe
  that whan he is deed 
   he shal no thyng bere with hym out of this world
  
   and therfore seith seint austyn that  the avaricious man is likned unto helle
  
   that the moore it swelweth the moore desir it hath to swelwe and devoure
   
   and as wel as ye wolde eschewe to be called an avaricious man or chynche
  
  1620 as wel sholde ye kepe yow and governe yow in swich a wise that men calle yow nat fool large
  
   therfore seith tullius
   the goodes
   he seith
   of thyn hous ne sholde nat been hyd ne kept so cloos
  
   but that they myghte been opened by pitee and debonairetee  
    that is to seyn
  to yeven part to hem that han greet nede 
  
    ne thy goodes shullen nat been so opene to been every mannes goodes
   
   afterward
  in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge hem ye shul alwey have thre thynges in youre herte 
    that is to seyn
  oure lord god
  conscience
  and good name 
  
   first
  ye shul have god in youre herte
  
   and for no richesse ye shullen do no thyng which may in any manere displese god
  
   that is youre creatour and makere
  
   for after the word of salomon
   it is bettre to have a litel good with the love of god 
   than to have muchel good and tresour and lese the love of his lord god
   
  1630 and the prophete seith that  bettre it is to been a good man and have litel good and tresour 
   than to been holden a shrewe and have grete richesses
   
   and yet seye i ferthermoore
  that ye sholde alwey doon youre bisynesse to gete yow richesses
  
   so that ye gete hem with good conscience
  
   and th  apostle seith that  ther nys thyng in this world of which 
   we sholden have so greet joye as whan oure conscience bereth us good witnesse
   
   and the wise man seith
   the substance of a man is ful good
  
   whan synne is nat in mannes conscience
   
   afterward
  in getynge of youre richesses and in usynge of hem
  
   yow moste have greet bisynesse and greet diligence that youre goode name be alwey kept and conserved
  
   for salomon seith that  bettre it is and moore it availleth a man to have a good name 
   than for to have grete richesses
   
   and therfore he seith in another place
   do greet diligence
   seith salomon
  
    in kepyng of thy freend and of thy goode name
  
  1640 for it shal lenger abide with thee than any tresour
  be it never so precious
   
   and certes he sholde nat be called a gentil man that after god and good conscience
  alle thynges left
  
   ne dooth his diligence and bisynesse to kepen his goode name
  
   and cassidore seith that  it is signe of a gentil herte 
   whan a man loveth and desireth to han a good name
   
   and therfore seith seint austyn that  ther been two thynges that arn necessarie and nedefulle
  
   and that is good conscience and good loos
  
   that is to seyn
  good conscience to thyn owene persone inward and good loos for thy neighebor outward
   
   and he that trusteth hym so muchel in his goode conscience 
   that he displeseth
  and setteth at noght his goode name or loos
  
   and rekketh noght though he kepe nat his goode name
  nys but a crueel cherl
  
   
 sire
  now have i shewed yow how ye shul do in getynge richesses
  and how ye shullen usen hem
  
   and i se wel that for the trust that ye han in youre richesses 
   ye wole moeve werre and bataille
  
  1650 i conseille yow that ye bigynne no werre in trust of youre richesses
  
  1650a for they ne suffisen noght werres to mayntene
  
   and therfore seith a philosophre
   that man that desireth and wole algates han werre
  shal nevere have suffisaunce
  
   for the richer that he is
  the gretter despenses moste he make
  if he wole have worshipe and victorie
   
   and salomon seith that  the gretter richesses that a man hath
  the mo despendours he hath
   
   and
  deere sire
  al be it so that for youre richesses ye mowe have muchel folk
  
   yet bihoveth it nat
  ne it is nat good
  to bigynne werre whereas ye mowe 
   in oother manere have pees unto youre worshipe and profit
  
   for the victorie of batailles that been in this world lyth nat in greet nombre or multitude 
   of the peple
  ne in the vertu of man
  
   but it lith in the wyl and in the hand of oure lord god almyghty
  
   and therfore judas machabeus
  which was goddes knyght
  
   whan he sholde fighte agayn his adversarie that hadde a gretter nombre 
   and a gretter multitude of folk and strenger than was this peple of machabee
  
  1660 yet he reconforted his litel compaignye
  and seyde right in this wise
  
    als lightly
   quod he
   may oure lord god almyghty yeve victorie to a fewe folk as to many folk
  
   for the victorie of a bataile comth nat by the grete nombre of peple
  
   but it cometh from oure lord god of hevene
   
   and
  deere sire
  for as muchel as ther is no man certein if he be worthy that 
   god yeve hym victorie 
  
  
  or naught
  after that salomon seith
  
   therfore every man sholde greetly drede werres to bigynne
  
   and by cause that in batailles fallen manye perils
  
   and happeth outher while that as soone is the grete man slayn as the litel man
  
   and as it is writen in the seconde book of kynges
  
    the dedes of batailles been aventurouse and nothyng certeyne
  
   for as lightly is oon hurt with a spere as another 
  
  1670 and for ther is gret peril in werre
  therfore sholde a man flee and eschue werre
  
  1670a in as muchel as a man may goodly
  
   for salomon seith
   he that loveth peril shal falle in peril
  
  
   after that dame prudence hadde spoken in this manere
  melibee answerde and seyde
  
   
 i see wel
  dame prudence
  that by youre faire wordes and by youre resouns 
   that ye han shewed me
  that the werre liketh yow no thyng
  
   but i have nat yet herd youre conseil
  how i shal do in this nede
 
  
   
 certes
 
  quod she
  
 i conseille yow that ye accorde with youre adversaries and that ye have pees with hem
  
   for seint jame seith in his epistles that  by concord and pees the smale richesses wexen grete
  
   and by debaat and discord the grete richesses fallen doun
   
   and ye knowen wel that oon of the gretteste and moost sovereyn thyng 
   that is in this world is unytee and pees
  
   and therfore seyde oure lord jhesu crist to his apostles in this wise
  
  1680  wel happy and blessed been they that loven and purchacen pees
  for they been called children of god
  
  
   
 a
 
  quod melibee
  
 now se i wel that ye loven nat myn honour ne my worshipe
  
   ye knowen wel that myne adversaries han bigonnen this debaat and bryge by hire outrage
  
   and ye se wel that they ne requeren ne preyen me nat of pees
  
   ne they asken nat to be reconsiled
  
   wol ye thanne that i go and meke me
  and obeye me to hem
  and crie hem mercy
  
   for sothe
  that were nat my worshipe
  
   for right as men seyn that  over greet hoomlynesse engendreth dispreisynge
   so fareth it by to greet humylitee or mekenesse
 
  
   thanne bigan dame prudence to maken semblant of wratthe and seyde
  
   
 certes
  sire
  sauf youre grace
  i love youre honour and youre profit 
   as i do myn owene
  and evere have doon
  
   ne ye
  ne noon oother
  seyn nevere the contrarie
  
  1690 and yit if i hadde seyd that ye sholde han purchaced the pees 
  1690a and the reconsiliacioun
  i ne hadde nat muchel mystaken me ne seyd amys
  
   for the wise man seith
   the dissensioun bigynneth by another man
  and the reconsilyng bygynneth by thyself
   
   and the prophete seith
   flee shrewednesse and do goodnesse
  
   seke pees and folwe it
  as muchel as in thee is
   
   yet seye i nat that ye shul rather pursue to youre adversaries for pees than they shuln to yow
  
   for i knowe wel that ye been so hard herted that ye wol do no thyng for me
  
   and salomon seith
   he that hath over hard an herte
  atte laste he shal myshappe and mystyde
  
  
   whanne melibee hadde herd dame prudence maken semblant of wratthe
  he seyde in this wise
  
   
 dame
  i prey yow that ye be nat displesed of thynges that i seye
  
   for ye knowe wel that i am angry and wrooth
  and that is no wonder
  
  1700 and they that been wrothe witen nat wel what they don ne what they seyn
  
   therfore the prophete seith that  troubled eyen han no cleer sighte
   
   but seyeth and conseileth me as yow liketh
  for i am redy to do right as ye wol desire
  
   and if ye repreve me of my folye
  
   i am the moore holden to love yow and to preyse yow
  
   for salomon seith that  he that repreveth hym that dooth folye
  
   he shal fynde gretter grace than he that deceyveth hym by sweete wordes
  
  
   thanne seide dame prudence
  
 i make no semblant of wratthe ne anger
  but for youre grete profit
  
   for salomon seith
   he is moore worth that repreveth or chideth a fool for his folye
  
   shewynge hym semblant of wratthe
  
   than he that supporteth hym and preyseth hym in his mysdoynge and laugheth at his folye
   
   and this same salomon seith afterward that 
    by the sorweful visage of a man  
    that is to seyn by the sory and hevy contenaunce of a man  
  1710  the fool correcteth and amendeth hymself
  
  
   thanne seyde melibee
  
 i shal nat konne answere to 
   so manye faire resouns as ye putten to me and shewen
  
   seyeth shortly youre wyl and youre conseil
  and i am al redy to fulfille and parfourne it
 
  
   thanne dame prudence discovered al hir wyl to hym and seyde
  
   
 i conseille yow
 
  quod she
  
 aboven alle thynges
  that ye make pees bitwene god and yow
  
   and beth reconsiled unto hym and to his grace
  
   for
  as i have seyd yow heer biforn
  god hath suffred yow 
   to have this tribulacioun and disese for youre synnes
  
   and if ye do as i sey yow
  god wol sende youre adversaries unto yow 
   and maken hem fallen at youre feet
  redy to do youre wyl and youre comandementz
  
   for salomon seith
   whan the condicioun of man is plesaunt and likynge to god
  
  1720 he chaungeth the hertes of the mannes adversaries and constreyneth hem to biseken hym of pees and of grace
   
   and i prey yow lat me speke with youre adversaries in privee place
  
   for they shul nat knowe that it be of youre wyl or of youre assent
  
   and thanne
  whan i knowe hir wil and hire entente
  i may conseille yow the moore seurely
 
  
   
 dame
 
  quod melibee
  
 dooth youre wil and youre likynge
  
   for i putte me hoolly in youre disposicioun and ordinaunce
 
  
   thanne dame prudence
  whan she saugh the goode wyl of hir housbonde
  delibered and took avys in hirself
  
   thinkinge how she myghte brynge this nede unto a good conclusioun and to a good ende
  
   and whan she saugh hir tyme
  she sente for thise adversaries to come unto hire into a pryvee place 
   and shewed wisely unto hem the grete goodes that comen of pees 
  1730 and the grete harmes and perils that been in werre
  
   and seyde to hem in a goodly manere hou that hem oughten have greet repentaunce 
   of the injurie and wrong that they hadden doon to melibee hir lord
  
   and unto hire
  and to hire doghter
  
   and whan they herden the goodliche wordes of dame prudence
  
   they weren so supprised and ravysshed and hadden so greet joye of hire that wonder was to telle
  
   
 a
  lady
 
  quod they
  
 ye han shewed unto us the blessynge of swetnesse
  
   after the sawe of david the prophete
  
   for the reconsilynge which we been nat worthy to have in no manere
  
   but we oghte requeren it with greet contricioun and humylitee
  
   ye of youre grete goodnesse have presented unto us
  
   now se we wel that the science and the konnynge of salomon is ful trewe
  
  1740 for he seith that  sweete wordes multiplien and encreescen freendes and maken shrewes to be debonaire and meeke
   
   
 certes
 
  quod they
  
 we putten oure dede and al oure matere and cause al hoolly in youre goode wyl 
   and been redy to obeye to the speche and comandement of my lord melibee
  
   and therfore
  deere and benygne lady
  we preien yow and biseke yow as mekely as we konne and mowen 
   that it lyke unto youre grete goodnesse to fulfillen in dede youre goodliche wordes
  
   for we consideren and knowelichen that we han offended and greved my lord melibee out of mesure
  
   so ferforth that we be nat of power to maken his amendes
  
   and therfore we oblige and bynden us and oure freendes for to doon al his wyl and his comandementz
  
   but peraventure he hath swich hevynesse and swich wratthe to us ward by cause of oure offense 
   that he wole enjoyne us swich a peyne as we mowe nat bere ne susteene
  
  1750 and therfore
  noble lady
  we biseke to youre wommanly pitee 
   to taken swich avysement in this nede that 
   we ne oure freendes be nat desherited ne destroyed thurgh oure folye
 
  
   
 certes
 
  quod prudence
  
 it is an hard thyng and right perilous 
   that a man putte hym al outrely in the arbitracioun and juggement
  
   and in the myght and power of his enemys
  
   for salomon seith
   leeveth me
  and yeveth credence to that i shal seyn
  i seye
   quod he
  
    ye peple
  folk and governours of hooly chirche
  
   to thy sone
  to thy wyf
  to thy freend
  ne to thy broother 
   ne yeve thou nevere myght ne maistrie of thy body whil thou lyvest
   
   now sithen he deffendeth that man sholde nat yeven to his broother 
   ne to his freend the myght of his body
  
   by a strenger resoun he deffendeth and forbedeth a man to yeven hymself to his enemy
  
   and nathelees i conseille you that ye mystruste nat my lord
  
  1760 for i woot wel and knowe verraily that he is debonaire and meeke
  large
  curteys
  
   and nothyng desirous ne coveitous of good ne richesse
  
   for ther nys nothyng in this world that he desireth
  save oonly worshipe and honour
  
   forthermoore i knowe wel and am right seur that he shal nothyng doon in this nede withouten my conseil
  
   and i shal so werken in this cause that by the grace of oure lord god 
   ye shul been reconsiled unto us
 
  
   thanne seyden they with o voys
  
 worshipful lady
  we putten us 
   and oure goodes al fully in youre wil and disposicioun
  
   and been redy to comen
  what day that it like unto youre noblesse to lymyte us or assigne us
  
   for to maken oure obligacioun and boond as strong as it liketh unto youre goodnesse
  
   that we mowe fulfille the wille of yow and of my lord melibee
 
  
   whan dame prudence hadde herd the answeres of thise men
  she bad hem goon agayn prively
  
  1770 and she retourned to hir lord melibee
  and tolde hym how she foond his adversaries ful repentant
  
   knowelechynge ful lowely hir synnes and trespas
  and how they were redy to suffren all peyne
  
   requirynge and preiynge hym of mercy and pitee
  
   thanne seyde melibee
  
 he is wel worthy to have pardoun 
   and foryifnesse of his synne
  that excuseth nat his synne 
   but knowelecheth it and repenteth hym
  axinge indulgence
  
   for senec seith
   ther is the remissioun and foryifnesse
  where as the confessioun is
   
   for confessioun is neighebor to innocence
  
   and he seith in another place that  he that hath shame of his synne and knowlecheth 
    it is worthy remissioun 
   and therfore i assente and conferme me to have pees
  
   but it is good that we do it nat withouten the assent and wyl of oure freendes
 
  
   thanne was prudence right glad and joyeful and seyde
  
  1780 
 certes
  sire
 
  quod she
  
 ye han wel and goodly answered
  
   for right as by the conseil
  assent
  and help of youre freendes 
   ye han been stired to venge yow and maken werre
  
   right so withouten hire conseil shul ye nat accorden yow ne have pees with youre adversaries
  
   for the lawe seith
   ther nys no thyng so good by wey of kynde as a thyng 
   to be unbounde by hym that it was ybounde
  
  
   and thanne dame prudence withouten delay or tariynge sente anon hire messages for hire kyn 
   and for hire olde freendes which that were trewe and wyse
  
   and tolde hem by ordre in the presence of melibee al this mateere 
   as it is aboven expressed and declared
  
   and preyden hem that they wolde yeven hire avys and conseil what best were to doon in this nede
  
   and whan melibees freendes hadde taken hire avys and deliberacioun of the forseide mateere
  
   and hadden examyned it by greet bisynesse and greet diligence
  
   they yave ful conseil for to have pees and reste
  
  1790 and that melibee sholde receyve with good herte his adversaries to foryifnesse and mercy
  
   and whan dame prudence hadde herd the assent of hir lord melibee
  and the conseil of his freendes 
   accorde with hire wille and hire entencioun
  
   she was wonderly glad in hire herte and seyde
  
   
 ther is an old proverbe
 
  quod she
  
 seith that  the goodnesse that thou mayst do this day
  do it
  
   and abide nat ne delaye it nat til tomorwe
   
   and therfore i conseille that ye sende youre messages
  swiche as been discrete and wise
  
   unto youre adversaries
  tellynge hem on youre bihalve 
   that if they wole trete of pees and of accord
  
   that they shape hem withouten delay or tariyng to comen unto us
 
  
  1800 which thyng parfourned was in dede
  
   and whanne thise trespassours and repentynge folk of hire folies 
      that is to seyn
  the adversaries of melibee    
   hadden herd what thise messagers seyden unto hem
  
   they weren right glad and joyeful
  and answereden ful mekely and benignely
  
   yeldynge graces and thankynges to hir lord melibee and to al his compaignye
  
   and shopen hem withouten delay to go with the messagers and obeye to the comandement of hir lord melibee
  
   and right anon they tooken hire wey to the court of melibee
  
   and tooken with hem somme of hire trewe freendes 
   to maken feith for hem and for to been hire borwes
  
   and whan they were comen to the presence of melibee
  he seyde hem thise wordes
  
   
 it standeth thus
 
  quod melibee
  
 and sooth it is
  that ye
  
  1810 causelees and withouten skile and resoun
  
   han doon grete injuries and wronges to me and to my wyf prudence and to my doghter also
  
   for ye han entred into myn hous by violence
  
   and have doon swich outrage that alle men knowen wel that ye have disserved the deeth
  
   and therfore wol i knowe and wite of yow 
   wheither ye wol putte the punyssement and the chastisynge and the vengeance of this outrage in the wyl 
   of me and of my wyf prudence
  or ye wol nat
 
  
   thanne the wiseste of hem thre answerde for hem alle and seyde
  
   
 sire
 
  quod he
  
 we knowen wel that we been unworthy to comen unto the court 
   of so greet a lord and so worthy as ye been
  
   for we han so greetly mystaken us
  and han offended 
   and agilt in swich a wise agayn youre heigh lordshipe 
   that trewely we han disserved the deeth
  
  1820 but yet
  for the grete goodnesse and debonairetee that al the world witnesseth of youre persone
  
   we submytten us to the excellence and benignitee of youre gracious lordshipe
  
   and been redy to obeie to alle youre comandementz
  
   bisekynge yow that of youre merciable pitee ye wol considere oure grete repentaunce and lowe submyssioun 
   and graunten us foryevenesse of oure outrageous trespas and offense
  
   for wel we knowe that youre liberal grace and mercy 
   strecchen hem ferther into goodnesse than doon oure outrageouse giltes and trespas into wikkednesse
  
   al be it that cursedly and dampnablely we han agilt agayn youre heigh lordshipe
 
  
   thanne melibee took hem up fro the ground ful benignely
  
   and receyved hire obligaciouns and hir boondes by hire othes upon hire plegges and borwes
  
   and assigned hem a certeyn day to retourne unto his court 
  1830 for to accepte and receyve the sentence and juggement that melibee wolde comande 
  1830a to be doon on hem by the causes aforeseyd
  
   whiche thynges ordeyned
  every man retourned to his hous
  
   and whan that dame prudence saugh hir tyme
  she freyned and axed hir lord melibee 
   what vengeance he thoughte to taken of his adversaries
  
   to which melibee answerde and seyde
  
 certes
 
  quod he
  
 i thynke and purpose me fully 
   to desherite hem of al that evere they han and for to putte hem in exil for evere
 
  
   
 certes
 
  quod dame prudence
  
 this were a crueel sentence and muchel agayn resoun
  
   for ye been riche ynough and han no nede of oother mennes good
  
   and ye myghte lightly in this wise gete yow a coveitous name
  
   which is a vicious thyng
  and oghte been eschued of every good man
  
  1840 for after the sawe of the word of the apostle
   coveitise is roote of alle harmes
   
   and therfore it were bettre for yow to lese so muchel good of youre owene 
   than for to taken of hir good in this manere
  
   for bettre it is to lesen good with worshipe than it is to wynne good with vileynye and shame
  
   and everi man oghte to doon his diligence and his bisynesse to geten hym a good name
  
   and yet shal he nat oonly bisie hym in kepynge of his good name
  
   but he shal also enforcen hym alwey to do somthyng by which he may renovelle his good name
  
   for it is writen that  the olde good loos or good name of a man is soone goon 
   and passed
  whan it is nat newed ne renovelled
   
   and as touchynge that ye seyn ye wole exile youre adversaries
  
   that thynketh me muchel agayn resoun and out of mesure
  
   considered the power that they han yeve yow upon hemself
  
  1850 and it is writen that  he is worthy to lesen his privilege that mysuseth 
  1850a the myght and the power that is yeven hym
   
   and i sette cas ye myghte enjoyne hem that peyne by right and by lawe
  
   which i trowe ye mowe nat do
  
   i seye ye mighte nat putten it to execucioun peraventure
  
   and thanne were it likly to retourne to the werre as it was biforn
  
   and therfore
  if ye wole that men do yow obeisance
  ye moste deemen moore curteisly
  
   this is to seyn
  ye moste yeven moore esy sentences and juggementz
  
   for it is writen that  he that moost curteisly comandeth
  to hym men moost obeyen
   
   and therfore i prey yow that in this necessitee and in this nede 
   ye caste yow to overcome youre herte
  
   for senec seith that  he that overcometh his herte overcometh twies
   
  1860 and tullius seith
   ther is no thyng so comendable in a greet lord 
   as whan he is debonaire and meeke
  and appeseth him lightly
   
   and i prey yow that ye wole forbere now to do vengeance
  
   in swich a manere that youre goode name may be kept and conserved
  
   and that men mowe have cause and mateere to preyse yow of pitee and of mercy
  
   and that ye have no cause to repente yow of thyng that ye doon
  
   for senec seith
   he overcometh in an yvel manere that repenteth hym of his victorie
   
   wherfore i pray yow
  lat mercy been in youre herte
  
   to th  effect and entente that god almighty have mercy on yow in his laste juggement
  
   for seint jame seith in his epistle
   juggement withouten mercy shal be doon 
   to hym that hath no mercy of another wight
  
  
  1870 whanne melibee hadde herd the grete skiles and resouns of dame prudence
  and hire wise informaciouns and techynges
  
   his herte gan enclyne to the wil of his wif
  considerynge hir trewe entente
  
   and conformed hym anon and assented fully to werken after hir conseil
  
   and thonked god
  of whom procedeth al vertu and alle goodnesse
  
   that hym sente a wyf of so greet discrecioun
  
   and whan the day cam that his adversaries sholde appieren in his presence
  
   he spak unto hem ful goodly
  and seyde in this wyse
  
   
 al be it so that of youre pride and heigh presumpcioun and folie
  and of youre necligence and unkonnynge
  
   ye have mysborn yow and trespassed unto me
  
   yet for as muche as i see and biholde youre grete humylitee 
   and that ye been sory and repentant of youre giltes
  
  1880 it constreyneth me to doon yow grace and mercy
  
   wherfore i receyve yow to my grace 
   and foryeve yow outrely alle the offenses
  injuries
  and wronges that ye have doon agayn me and myne
  
   to this effect and to this ende
  that god of his endelees mercy 
   wole at the tyme of oure diynge foryeven us oure giltes 
   that we han trespassed to hym in this wrecched world
  
   for doutelees
  if we be sory and repentant of the synnes and giltes which we han trespassed 
   in the sighte of oure lord god
  
   he is so free and so merciable 
   that he wole foryeven us oure giltes 
   and bryngen us to the blisse that nevere hath ende
 
  amen
