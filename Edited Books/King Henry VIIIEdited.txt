the famous history of the life of king henry the eight 
   
  the prologve
  
   
   
  i come no more to make you laugh
  things now
  
  that beare a weighty
  and a serious brow
  
  sad
  high
  and working
  full of state and woe
  
  such noble scoenes
  as draw the eye to flow 
  we now present
  those that can pitty
  heere 
  may  if they thinke it well  let fall a teare
  
  the subiect will deserue it
  such as giue 
  their money out of hope they may beleeue
  
  may heere finde truth too
  those that come to see 
  onely a show or two
  and so agree
  
  the play may passe
  if they be still
  and willing
  
  ile vndertake may see away their shilling 
  richly in two short houres
  onely they 
  that come to heare a merry
  bawdy play
  
  a noyse of targets
  or to see a fellow 
  in a long motley coate
  garded with yellow
  
  will be deceyu d
  for gentle hearers
  know 
  to ranke our chosen truth with such a show 
  as foole
  and fight is
  beside forfeyting 
  our owne braines
  and the opinion that we bring 
  to make that onely true
  we now intend
  
  will leaue vs neuer an vnderstanding friend
  
  therefore
  for goodnesse sake
  and as you are knowne 
  the first and happiest hearers of the towne
  
  be sad
  as we would make ye
  thinke ye see 
  the very persons of our noble story
  
  as they were liuing
  thinke you see them great
  
  and follow d with the generall throng
  and sweat 
  of thousand friends
  then
  in a moment
  see 
  how soone this mightinesse
  meets misery
  
  and if you can be merry then
  ile say
  
  a man may weepe vpon his wedding day

  at the other
  the duke of 
  buckingham
  and the lord aburgauenny
  
   
    buckingham
  good morrow
  and well met
  how haue ye done 
  since last we saw in france
  
    norf
  i thanke your grace
  
  healthfull
  and euer since a fresh admirer 
  of what i saw there 
   
     buck
  an vntimely ague 
  staid me a prisoner in my chamber
  when 
  those sunnes of glory
  those two lights of men 
  met in the vale of andren 
   
     nor
   twixt guynes and arde
  
  i was then present
  saw them salute on horsebacke
  
  beheld them when they lighted
  how they clung 
  in their embracement
  as they grew together
  
  which had they
  
  what foure thron d ones could haue weigh d 
  such a compounded one
  
    buck
  all the whole time 
  i was my chambers prisoner 
   
     nor
  then you lost 
  the view of earthly glory
  men might say 
  till this time pompe was single
  but now married 
  to one aboue it selfe
  each following day 
  became the next dayes master
  till the last 
  made former wonders
  it s
  to day the french
  
  all clinquant all in gold
  like heathen gods 
  shone downe the english
  and to morrow
  they 
  made britaine
  india
  euery man that stood
  
  shew d like a mine
  their dwarfish pages were 
  as cherubins
  all gilt
  the madams too
  
  not vs d to toyle
  did almost sweat to beare 
  the pride vpon them
  that their very labour 
  was to them
  as a painting
  now this maske 
  was cry de incompareable
  and th  ensuing night 
  made it a foole
  and begger
  the two kings 
  equall in lustre
  were now best
  now worst 
  as presence did present them
  him in eye
  
  still him in praise
  and being present both
  
   twas said they saw but one
  and no discerner 
  durst wagge his tongue in censure
  when these sunnes 
   for so they phrase  em  by their heralds challeng d 
  the noble spirits to armes
  they did performe 
  beyond thoughts compasse
  that former fabulous storie 
  being now seene
  possible enough
  got credit 
  that beuis was beleeu d 
   
     buc
  oh you go farre 
   
     nor
  as i belong to worship
  and affect 
  in honor
  honesty
  the tract of eu ry thing
  
  would by a good discourser loose some life
  
  which actions selfe
  was tongue too 
   
     buc
  all was royall
  
  to the disposing of it nought rebell d
  
  order gaue each thing view
  the office did 
  distinctly his full function
  who did guide
  
  i meane who set the body
  and the limbes 
  of this great sport together
  
    nor
  as you guesse
  
  one certes
  that promises no element 
  in such a businesse 
   
     buc
  i pray you who
  my lord
  
    nor
  all this was ordred by the good discretion 
  of the right reuerend cardinall of yorke 
   
     buc
  the diuell speed him
  no mans pye is freed 
  from his ambitious finger
  what had he 
  to do in these fierce vanities
  i wonder
  
  that such a keech can with his very bulke 
  take vp the rayes o th  beneficiall sun
  
  and keepe it from the earth 
   
     nor
  surely sir
  
  there s in him stuffe
  that put s him to these ends
  
  for being not propt by auncestry
  whose grace 
  chalkes successors their way
  nor call d vpon 
  for high feats done to th  crowne
  neither allied 
  to eminent assistants
  but spider like 
  out of his selfe drawing web
  o giues vs note
  
  the force of his owne merit makes his way 
  a guift that heauen giues for him
  which buyes 
  a place next to the king 
   
     abur
  i cannot tell 
  what heauen hath giuen him
  let some grauer eye 
  pierce into that
  but i can see his pride 
  peepe through each part of him
  whence ha s he that
  
  if not from hell
  the diuell is a niggard
  
  or ha s giuen all before
  and he begins 
  a new hell in himselfe 
   
     buc
  why the diuell
  
  vpon this french going out
  tooke he vpon him 
   without the priuity o th  king  t  appoint 
  who should attend on him
  he makes vp the file 
  of all the gentry
  for the most part such 
  to whom as great a charge
  as little honor 
  he meant to lay vpon
  and his owne letter 
  the honourable boord of councell
  out 
  must fetch him in
  he papers 
   
     abur
  i do know 
  kinsmen of mine
  three at the least
  that haue 
  by this
  so sicken d their estates
  that neuer 
  they shall abound as formerly 
   
     buc
  o many 
  haue broke their backes with laying mannors on  em 
  for this great iourney
  what did this vanity 
  but minister communication of 
  a most poore issue 
   
     nor
  greeuingly i thinke
  
  the peace betweene the french and vs
  not valewes 
  the cost that did conclude it 
   
     buc
  euery man
  
  after the hideous storme that follow d
  was 
  a thing inspir d
  and not consulting
  broke 
  into a generall prophesie
  that this tempest 
  dashing the garment of this peace
  aboaded 
  the sodaine breach on t 
   
     nor
  which is budded out
  
  for france hath flaw d the league
  and hath attach d 
  our merchants goods at burdeux 
   
     abur
  is it therefore 
  th  ambassador is silenc d
  
    nor
  marry is t 
   
     abur
  a proper title of a peace
  and purchas d 
  at a superfluous rate 
   
     buc
  why all this businesse 
  our reuerend cardinall carried 
   
     nor
  like it your grace
  
  the state takes notice of the priuate difference 
  betwixt you
  and the cardinall
  i aduise you 
   and take it from a heart
  that wishes towards you 
  honor
  and plenteous safety  that you reade 
  the cardinals malice
  and his potency 
  together
  to consider further
  that 
  what his high hatred would effect
  wants not 
  a minister in his power
  you know his nature
  
  that he s reuengefull
  and i know
  his sword 
  hath a sharpe edge
  it s long
  and t may be saide 
  it reaches farre
  and where  twill not extend
  
  thither he darts it
  bosome vp my counsell
  
  you l finde it wholesome
  loe
  where comes that rock 
  that i aduice your shunning
  
  enter cardinall wolsey
  the purse borne before him
  certaine of 
  the guard
  
  and two secretaries with papers
  the cardinall in his passage
  
  fixeth his 
  eye on buckingham
  and buckingham on him

  disdaine

  we shall then know more
    buckingham

  and his traine

  this butchers curre is venom d mouth d
  and i 
  haue not the power to muzzle him
  therefore best 
  not wake him in his slumber
  a beggers booke
  
  out worths a nobles blood

  what are you chaff d
  
  aske god for temp rance

  he s gone to th  king

     nor
  stay my lord
  
  and let your reason with your choller question 
  what  tis you go about
  to climbe steepe hilles

  i am thankfull to you

  from sincere motions
  by intelligence

  when 
  wee see each graine of grauell

    make my vouch as strong 
  as shore of rocke

  as able to perform t  his minde
  and place 
  infecting one another
  yea reciprocally
  
  only to shew his pompe
  as well in france
  
  as here at home
  suggests the king our master 
  to this last costly treaty
  th  enteruiew
  
  that swallowed so much treasure
  and like a glasse 
  did breake ith  wrenching 
   
     norf
  faith
  and so it did 
   
     buck
  pray giue me fauour sir
  this cunning cardinall 
  the articles o th  combination drew 
  as himselfe pleas d
  and they were ratified 
  as he cride thus let be
  to as much end
  
  as giue a crutch to th  dead
  but our count cardinall 
  has done this
  and tis well
  for worthy wolsey 
   who cannot erre  he did it
  now this followes
  
   which as i take it
  is a kinde of puppie 
  to th  old dam treason  charles the emperour
  
  vnder pretence to see the queene his aunt
  
   for twas indeed his colour
  but he came 
  to whisper wolsey  here makes visitation
  
  his feares were that the interview betwixt 
  england and france
  might through their amity 
  breed him some preiudice
  for from this league
  
  peep d harmes that menac d him
  priuily 
  deales with our cardinal
  and as i troa 
  which i doe well
  for i am sure the emperour 
  paid ere he promis d
  whereby his suit was granted 
  ere it was ask d
  but when the way was made 
  and pau d with gold
  the emperor thus desir d
  
  that he would please to alter the kings course
  
  and breake the foresaid peace
  let the king know 
   as soone he shall by me  that thus the cardinall 
  does buy and sell his honour as he pleases
  
  and for his owne aduantage 
   
     norf
  i am sorry

  these exactions 
   whereof my soueraigne would haue note  they are 
  most pestilent to th  hearing

  tongues spit their duties out

  out of the duke of buckingham 
   
     kin
  speake freely 
   
     sur
  first
  it was vsuall with him
  euery day 
  it would infect his speech
  that if the king 
  should without issue dye
  hee l carry it so 
  to make the scepter his
  these very words 
  i ue heard him vtter to his sonne in law
  
  lord aburgany
  to whom by oth he menac d 
  reuenge vpon the cardinall 
   
     card
  please your highnesse note 
  this dangerous conception in this point
  
  not frended by his wish to your high person
  
  his will is most malignant
  and it stretches 
  beyond you to your friends 
   
     queen
  my learn d lord cardinall
  
  deliuer all with charity 
   
     kin
  speake on
  
  how grounded hee his title to the crowne 
  vpon our faile
  to this poynt hast thou heard him
  
  at any time speake ought
  
    sur
  he was brought to this
  
  by a vaine prophesie of nicholas henton 
   
     kin
  what was that henton
  
    sur
  sir
  a chartreux fryer
  
  his confessor
  who fed him euery minute 
  with words of soueraignty 
   
     kin
  how know st thou this
  
    sur
  not long before your highnesse sped to france
  
  the duke being at the rose
  within the parish 
  saint laurence poultney
  did of me demand 
  what was the speech among the londoners
  
  concerning the french iourney
  i replide
  
  men feare the french would proue perfidious 
  to the kings danger
  presently
  the duke 
  said
   twas the feare indeed
  and that he doubted 
   twould proue the verity of certaine words 
  spoke by a holy monke
  that oft
  sayes he
  
  hath sent to me
  wishing me to permit 
  iohn de la car
  my chaplaine
  a choyce howre 
  to heare from him a matter of some moment
  
  whom after vnder the commissions seale
  
  he sollemnly had sworne
  that what he spoke 
  my chaplaine to no creature liuing
  but 
  to me
  should vtter
  with demure confidence
  
  this pausingly ensu de
  neither the king
  nor s heyres 
   tell you the duke  shall prosper
  bid him striue 
  to the loue o th  commonalty
  the duke 
  shall gouerne england 
   
     queen
  if i know you well
  
  you were the dukes surueyor
  and lost your office 
  on the complaint o th  tenants
  take good heed 
  you charge not in your spleene a noble person
  
  and spoyle your nobler soule
  i say
  take heed
  
  yes
  heartily beseech you 
   
     kin
  let him on
  goe forward 
   
     sur
  on my soule
  ile speake but truth
  
  i told my lord the duke
  by th  diuels illusions 
  the monke might be deceiu d
  and that  twas dangerous 
  for this to ruminate on this so farre
  vntill 
  it forg d him some designe
  which being beleeu d 
  it was much like to doe
  he answer d
  tush
  
  it can do me no damage
  adding further
  
  that had the king in his last sicknesse faild
  
  the cardinals and sir thomas louels heads 
  should haue gone off 
   
     kin

  i am sorry fort 
   
     1
  so are a number more 
   
     2
  but pray how past it
  
    1
  ile tell you in a little
  the great duke 
  came to the bar
  where
  to his accusations 
  he pleaded still not guilty
  and alleadged 
  many sharpe reasons to defeat the law
  
  the kings atturney on the contrary
  
  vrg d on the examinations
  proofes
  confessions 
  of diuers witnesses
  which the duke desir d 
  to him brought viua voce to his face
  
  at which appear d against him
  his surueyor 
  sir gilbert pecke his chancellour
  and iohn car
  
  confessor to him
  with that diuell monke
  
  hopkins
  that made this mischiefe 
   
     2
  that was hee 
  that fed him with his prophecies 
   
     1
  the same
  
  all these accus d him strongly
  which he faine 
  would haue flung from him
  but indeed he could not
  
  and so his peeres vpon this euidence
  
  haue found him guilty of high treason
  much 
  he spoke
  and learnedly for life
  but all 
  was either pittied in him
  or forgotten 
   
     2
  after all this
  how did he beare himselfe
  
    1
  when he was brought agen to th  bar
  to heare 
  his knell rung out
  his iudgement
  he was stir d 
  with such an agony
  he sweat extreamly
  
  and somthing spoke in choller
  ill
  and hasty
  
  but he fell to himselfe againe
  and sweetly
  
  in all the rest shew d a most noble patience 
   
     2
  i doe not thinke he feares death 
   
     1
  sure he does not
  
  he neuer was so womanish
  the cause 
  he may a little grieue at 
   
     2
  certainly
  
  the cardinall is the end of this 
   
     1
  tis likely
  
  by all coniectures
  first kildares attendure
  
  then deputy of ireland
  who remou d 
  earle surrey
  was sent thither
  and in hast too
  
  least he should helpe his father 
   
     2
  that tricke of state 
  was a deepe enuious one
  
    1
  at his returne
  
  no doubt he will requite it
  this is noted 
   and generally  who euer the king fauours
  
  the cardnall instantly will finde imployment
  
  and farre enough from court too 
   
     2
  all the commons 
  hate him perniciously
  and o  my conscience 
  wish him ten faddom deepe
  this duke as much 
  they loue and doate on
  call him bounteous buckingham
  
  the mirror of all courtesie
  
  enter buckingham from his arraignment
  tipstaues before him

  all good people
  
  you that thus farre haue come to pitty me
  
  heare what i say
  and then goe home and lose me
  
  i haue this day receiu d a traitors iudgement
  
  and by that name must dye
  yet heauen beare witnes
  
  and if i haue a conscience
  let it sincke me
  
  euen as the axe falls
  if i be not faithfull
  
  the law i beare no mallice for my death
  
  t has done vpon the premises
  but iustice
  
  but those that sought it
  i could wish more christians
  
   be what they will  i heartily forgiue  em
  
  yet let  em looke they glory not in mischiefe
  
  nor build their euils on the graues of great men
  
  for then
  my guiltlesse blood must cry against  em
  
  for further life in this world i ne re hope
  
  nor will i sue
  although the king haue mercies 
  more then i dare make faults
  
  you few that lou d me
  
  and dare be bold to weepe for buckingham
  
  his noble friends and fellowes
  whom to leaue 
  is only bitter to him
  only dying
  
  goe with me like good angels to my end
  
  and as the long diuorce of steele fals on me
  
  make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice
  
  and lift my soule to heauen
  
  lead on a gods name 
   
     louell
  i doe beseech your grace
  for charity

  a buzzing of a separation 
  betweene the king and katherine

  yes
  but it held not
  
  for when the king once heard it
  out of anger 
  he sent command to the lord mayor straight 
  to stop the rumor
  and allay those tongues 
  that durst disperse it 
   
     2
  but that slander sir
  
  is found a truth now
  for it growes agen 
  fresher then e re it was
  and held for certaine 
  the king will venture at it
  either the cardinall
  
  or some about him neere
  haue out of malice 
  to the good queene

  you haue hit the marke

  that she should feele the smart of this
  the cardinall 
  will haue his will
  and she must fall

  as much 
  as you haue done my truth
  if he know

  which might

  the least word that might

  barke when their fellowes doe
  by some of these 
  the queene is put in anger
  y are excus d
  
  but will you be more iustifi de
  you euer 
  haue wish d the sleeping of this busines
  neuer desir d 
  it to be stir d
  but oft haue hindred
  oft 
  the passages made toward it
  on my honour
  
  i speake my good lord cardnall
  to this point
  
  and thus farre cleare him
  
  now
  what mou d me too t
  
  i will be bold with time and your attention
  
  then marke th  inducement
  thus it came
  giue heede too t
  
  my conscience first receiu d a tendernes
  
  scruple
  and pricke
  on certaine speeches vtter d 
  by th  bishop of bayon
  then french embassador
  
  who had beene hither sent on the debating 
  and marriage  twixt the duke of orleance
  and 
  our daughter mary
  i th  progresse of this busines
  
  ere a determinate resolution
  hee 
   i meane the bishop  did require a respite
  
  wherein he might the king his lord aduertise
  
  whether our daughter were legitimate
  
  respecting this our marriage with the dowager
  
  sometimes our brothers wife
  this respite shooke 
  the bosome of my conscience
  enter d me
  
  yea
  with a spitting power
  and made to tremble 
  the region of my breast
  which forc d such way
  
  that many maz d considerings
  did throng 
  and prest in with this caution
  first
  me thought 
  i stood not in the smile of heauen
  who had 
  commanded nature
  that my ladies wombe 
  if it conceiu d a male child by me
  should 
  doe no more offices of life too t
  then 
  the graue does to th  dead
  for her male issue
  
  or di de where they were made
  or shortly after 
  this world had ayr d them
  hence i tooke a thought
  
  this was a iudgement on me
  that my kingdome 
   well worthy the best heyre o th  world  should not 
  be gladded in t by me
  then followes
  that 
  i weigh d the danger which my realmes stood in 
  by this my issues faile
  and that gaue to me 
  many a groaning throw
  thus hulling in 
  the wild sea of my conscience
  i did steere 
  toward this remedy
  whereupon we are 
  now present heere together
  that s to say
  
  i meant to rectifie my conscience
  which 
  i then did feele full sicke
  and yet not well
  
  by all the reuerend fathers of the land
  
  and doctors learn d
  first i began in priuate
  
  with you my lord of lincolne
  you remember 
  how vnder my oppression i did reeke 
  when i first mou d you 
   
     b
 lin
  very well my liedge 
   
     kin
  i haue spoke long
  be pleas d your selfe to say 
  how farre you satisfide me 
   
     lin
  so please your highnes
  
  the question did at first so stagger me
  
  bearing a state of mighty moment in t
  
  and consequence of dread
  that i committed 
  the daringst counsaile which i had to doubt
  
  and did entreate your highnes to this course
  
  which you are running heere 
   
     kin
  i then mou d you
  
  my lord of canterbury
  and got your leaue 
  to make this present summons vnsolicited
  
  i left no reuerend person in this court
  
  but by particular consent proceeded 
  vnder your hands and seales
  therefore goe on
  
  for no dislike i th  world against the person 
  of the good queene
  but the sharpe thorny points 
  of my alleadged reasons
  driues this forward
  
  proue but our marriage lawfull
  by my life 
   
  and kingly dignity
  we are contented 
  to weare our mortall state to come
  with her
  
   katherine our queene  before the primest creature 
  that s parragon d o th  world 
   
     camp
  so please your highnes

   tis a needfull fitnesse
  
  that we adiourne this court till further day
  
  meane while
  must be an earnest motion 
  made to the queene to call backe her appeale 
  she intends vnto his holinesse 
   
     kin

  that they may haue their wages
  duly paid  em
  
  and something ouer to remember me by
  
  if heauen had pleas d to haue giuen me longer life 
  and able meanes
  we had not parted thus
  
  these are the whole contents
  and good my lord
  
  by that you loue the deerest in this world

  might see from farre
  some forty truncheoners draw to
