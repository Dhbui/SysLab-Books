 whan phebus dwelled heere in this erthe adoun
  
   as olde bookes maken mencioun
  
   he was the mooste lusty bachiler 
   in al this world
  and eek the beste archer
  
   he slow phitoun
  the serpent
  as he lay 
  110 slepynge agayn the sonne upon a day
  
   and many another noble worthy dede 
   he with his bowe wroghte
  as men may rede
  
   pleyen he koude on every mynstralcie
  
   and syngen that it was a melodie 
   to heeren of his cleere voys the soun
  
   certes the kyng of thebes
  amphioun
  
   that with his syngyng walled that citee
  
   koude nevere syngen half so wel as hee
  
   therto he was the semelieste man 
  120 that is or was sith that the world bigan
  
   what nedeth it his fetures to discryve
  
   for in this world was noon so faire on lyve
  
   he was therwith fulfild of gentillesse
  
   of honour
  and of parfit worthynesse
  
   this phebus
  that was flour of bachilrie
  
   as wel in fredom as in chivalrie
  
   for his desport
  in signe eek of victorie 
   of phitoun
  so as telleth us the storie
  
   was wont to beren in his hand a bowe
  
  130 now hadde this phebus in his hous a crowe 
   which in a cage he fostred many a day
  
   and taughte it speken
  as men teche a jay
  
   whit was this crowe as is a snow whit swan
  
   and countrefete the speche of every man 
   he koude
  whan he sholde telle a tale
  
   therwith in al this world no nyghtyngale 
   ne koude
  by an hondred thousand deel
  
   syngen so wonder myrily and weel
  
   now hadde this phebus in his hous a wyf 
  140 which that he lovede moore than his lyf
  
   and nyght and day dide evere his diligence 
   hir for to plese and doon hire reverence
  
   save oonly
  if the sothe that i shal sayn
  
   jalous he was
  and wolde have kept hire fayn
  
   for hym were looth byjaped for to be
  
   and so is every wight in swich degree
  
   but al in ydel
  for it availleth noght
  
   a good wyf
  that is clene of werk and thoght
  
   sholde nat been kept in noon awayt
  certayn
  
  150 and trewely the labour is in vayn 
   to kepe a shrewe
  for it wol nat bee
  
   this holde i for a verray nycetee
  
   to spille labour for to kepe wyves
  
   thus writen olde clerkes in hir lyves
  
   but now to purpos
  as i first bigan
  
   this worthy phebus dooth al that he kan 
   to plesen hire
  wenynge for swich plesaunce
  
   and for his manhede and his governaunce
  
   that no man sholde han put hym from hir grace
  
  160 but god it woot
  ther may no man embrace 
   as to destreyne a thyng which that nature 
   hath natureelly set in a creature
  
   taak any bryd
  and put it in a cage
  
   and do al thyn entente and thy corage 
   to fostre it tendrely with mete and drynke 
   of alle deyntees that thou kanst bithynke
  
   and keep it al so clenly as thou may
  
   although his cage of gold be never so gay
  
   yet hath this brid
  by twenty thousand foold
  
  170 levere in a forest that is rude and coold 
   goon ete wormes and swich wrecchednesse
  
   for evere this brid wol doon his bisynesse 
   to escape out of his cage
  yif he may
  
   his libertee this brid desireth ay
  
   lat take a cat
  and fostre hym wel with milk 
   and tendre flessh
  and make his couche of silk
  
   and lat hym seen a mous go by the wal
  
   anon he weyveth milk and flessh and al
  
   and every deyntee that is in that hous
  
  180 swich appetit hath he to ete a mous
  
   lo
  heere hath lust his dominacioun
  
   and appetit fleemeth discrecioun
  
   a she wolf hath also a vileyns kynde
  
   the lewedeste wolf that she may fynde
  
   or leest of reputacioun
  wol she take
  
   in tyme whan hir lust to han a make
  
   alle thise ensamples speke i by thise men 
   that been untrewe
  and nothyng by wommen
  
   for men han evere a likerous appetit 
  190 on lower thyng to parfourne hire delit 
   than on hire wyves
  be they never so faire
  
   ne never so trewe
  ne so debonaire
  
   flessh is so newefangel
  with meschaunce
  
   that we ne konne in nothyng han plesaunce 
   that sowneth into vertu any while
  
   this phebus
  which that thoghte upon no gile
  
   deceyved was
  for al his jolitee
  
   for under hym another hadde shee
  
   a man of litel reputacioun
  
  200 nat worth to phebus in comparisoun
  
   the moore harm is
  it happeth ofte so
  
   of which ther cometh muchel harm and wo
  
   and so bifel
  whan phebus was absent
  
   his wyf anon hath for hir lemman sent
  
   hir lemman
  certes
  this is a knavyssh speche
  
   foryeveth it me
  and that i yow biseche
  
   the wise plato seith
  as ye may rede
  
   the word moot nede accorde with the dede
  
   if men shal telle proprely a thyng
  
  210 the word moot cosyn be to the werkyng
  
   i am a boystous man
  right thus seye i
  
   ther nys no difference
  trewely
  
   bitwixe a wyf that is of heigh degree
  
   if of hir body dishonest she bee
  
   and a povre wenche
  oother than this    
   if it so be they werke bothe amys    
   but that the gentile
  in estaat above
  
   she shal be cleped his lady
  as in love
  
   and for that oother is a povre womman
  
  220 she shal be cleped his wenche or his lemman
  
   and
  god it woot
  myn owene deere brother
  
   men leyn that oon as lowe as lith that oother
  
   right so bitwixe a titlelees tiraunt 
   and an outlawe or a theef erraunt
  
   the same i seye
  ther is no difference
  
   to alisaundre was toold this sentence
  
   that
  for the tirant is of gretter myght 
   by force of meynee for to sleen dounright
  
   and brennen hous and hoom
  and make al playn
  
  230 lo
  therfore is he cleped a capitayn
  
   and for the outlawe hath but smal meynee
  
   and may nat doon so greet an harm as he
  
   ne brynge a contree to so greet mescheef
  
   men clepen hym an outlawe or a theef
  
   but for i am a man noght textueel
  
   i wol noght telle of textes never a deel
  
   i wol go to my tale
  as i bigan
  
   whan phebus wyf had sent for hir lemman
  
   anon they wroghten al hire lust volage
  
  240 the white crowe
  that heeng ay in the cage
  
   biheeld hire werk
  and seyde never a word

  the crowe anon hym tolde
  
   by sadde tokenes and by wordes bolde
  
   how that his wyf had doon hire lecherye
