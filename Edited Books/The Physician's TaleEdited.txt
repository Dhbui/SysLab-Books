   this knyght a doghter hadde by his wyf
  
   no children hadde he mo in al his lyf
  
   fair was this mayde in excellent beautee 
   aboven every wight that man may see
  
   for nature hath with sovereyn diligence 
  10 yformed hire in so greet excellence
  
   as though she wolde seyn

   outher to grave
  or peynte
  or forge
  or bete
  
   if they presumed me to countrefete
  
   for he that is the formere principal 
  20 hath maked me his vicaire general
  
   to forme and peynten erthely creaturis 
   right as me list
  and ech thyng in my cure is 
   under the moone
  that may wane and waxe
  
   and for my werk right no thyng wol i axe
  
   my lord and i been ful of oon accord
  
   i made hire to the worshipe of my lord
  
   so do i alle myne othere creatures
  
   what colour that they han or what figures
 
  
   thus semeth me that nature wolde seye
  
  30 this mayde of age twelve yeer was and tweye
  
   in which that nature hadde swich delit
  
   for right as she kan peynte a lilie whit
  
   and reed a rose
  right with swich peynture

   er she were born
  upon hir lymes fre
  
   where as by right swiche colours sholde be
  
   and phebus dyed hath hire tresses grete 
   lyk to the stremes of his burned heete
  
   and if that excellent was hire beautee
  
  40 a thousand foold moore vertuous was she
  
   in hire ne lakked no condicioun 
   that is to preyse
  as by discrecioun
  
   as wel in goost as body chast was she
  
   for which she floured in virginitee 
   with alle humylitee and abstinence
  
   with alle attemperaunce and pacience
  
   with mesure eek of beryng and array
  
   discreet she was in answeryng alway
  
   though she were wis as pallas
  dar i seyn
  
  50 hir facound eek ful wommanly and pleyn
  
   no countrefeted termes hadde she 
   to seme wys
  but after hir degree 
   she spak
  and alle hire wordes

   sownynge in vertu and in gentillesse
  
   shamefast she was in maydens shamefastnesse
  
   constant in herte
  and evere in bisynesse 
   to dryve hire out of ydel slogardye
  
   bacus hadde of hir mouth right no maistrie
  
   for wyn and youthe dooth venus encresse
  
  60 as men in fyr wol casten oille or greesse
  
   and of hir owene vertu
  unconstreyned
  
   she hath ful ofte tyme syk hire feyned
  
   for that she wolde fleen the compaignye 
   where likly was to treten of folye
  
   as is at feestes
  revels
  and at daunces
  
   that been occasions of daliaunces
  
   swich thynges maken children for to be 
   to soone rype and boold
  as men may se
  
   which is ful perilous and hath been yoore
  
  70 for al to soone may she lerne loore 
   of booldnesse
  whan she woxen is a wyf
  
   and ye maistresses

  though it so pryvee be 
   that no man woot therof but god and he
  
   for be he lewed man
  or ellis lered
  
   he noot how soone that he shal been afered
  
   therfore i rede yow this conseil take
  
   forsaketh synne
  er synne yow forsake
