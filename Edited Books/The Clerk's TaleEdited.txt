   a corone on hire heed they han ydressed
  
   and sette hire ful of nowches grete and smale
  
   of hire array what sholde i make a tale
  
   unnethe the peple hir knew for hire fairnesse

   conveyed hire
  and thus the day they spende 
   in revel
  til the sonne gan descende
  
   and shortly forth this tale for to chace
  
   i seye that to this newe markysesse 
   god hath swich favour sent hire of his grace 
   that it ne semed nat by liklynesse 
   that she was born and fed in rudenesse
  
   as in a cote or in an oxe stalle

  of which i spak bifore
  
   she doghter were

  as by conjecture
  
   hem thoughte she was another creature
  
   for though that evere vertuous was she
  
   she was encressed in swich excellence 
   of thewes goode
  yset in heigh bountee
  
  410 and so discreet and fair of eloquence
  
   so benigne and so digne of reverence
  
   and koude so the peples herte embrace
  
   that ech hire lovede that looked on hir face
  
   noght oonly of saluces in the toun 
   publiced was the bountee of hir name
  
   but eek biside in many a regioun
  
   if oon seide wel
  another seyde the same
  
   so spradde of hire heighe bountee the fame 
   that men and wommen
  as wel yonge as olde

   thus walter lowely    nay

   wedded with fortunat honestetee
  
   in goddes pees lyveth ful esily 
   at hoom
  and outward grace ynogh had he

   was ofte vertu hid
  the peple hym heelde 
   a prudent man
  and that is seyn ful seelde
  
   nat oonly this grisildis thurgh hir wit 
   koude al the feet of wyfly hoomlinesse
  
  430 but eek
  whan that the cas required it
  
   the commune profit koude she redresse
  
   ther nas discord
  rancour
  ne hevynesse 
   in al that land that she ne koude apese
  
   and wisely brynge hem alle in reste and ese
  
   though that hire housbonde absent were anon
  
   if gentil men or othere of hire contree 
   were wrothe
  she wolde bryngen hem aton
  
   so wise and rype wordes hadde she

  as men wende
  
   peple to save and every wrong t  amende
  
   nat longe tyme after that this grisild 
   was wedded
  she a doghter hath ybore
  
   al had hire levere have born a knave child
  
   glad was this markys and the folk therfore

   she may unto a knave child atteyne 
   by liklihede
  syn she nys nat bareyne
  
   ther fil
  as it bifalleth tymes mo
  
  450 whan that this child had souked but a throwe
  
   this markys in his herte longeth so 
   to tempte his wyf
  hir sadnesse for to knowe
  
   that he ne myghte out of his herte throwe

   to assaye a wyf whan that it is no nede
  
   and putten hire in angwyssh and in drede
  
   for which this markys wroghte in this manere
  
   he cam allone a nyght

   glad was this markys of hire answeryng

 deth may noght make no comparisoun

  and whan this markys say 
   the constance of his wyf
  he caste adoun 
   his eyen two
  and wondreth that she may 
  670 in pacience suffre al this array
  
   and forth he goth with drery contenance
  
   but to his herte it was ful greet plesance
  
   this ugly sergeant
  in the same wyse 
   that he hire doghter caughte
  right so he    
   or worse
  if men worse kan devyse    
   hath hent hire sone
  that ful was of beautee
  
   and evere in oon so pacient was she 
   that she no chiere maade of hevynesse
  
   but kiste hir sone
  and after gan it blesse
  
  680 save this
  she preyede hym that
  if he myghte
  
   hir litel sone he wolde in erthe grave 
   his tendre lymes
  delicaat to sighte
  
   fro foweles and fro beestes for to save
  
   but she noon answere of hym myghte have
  
   he wente his wey
  as hym no thyng ne roghte
  
   but to boloigne he tendrely it broghte
  
   this markys wondred
  evere lenger the moore
  
   upon hir pacience
  and if that he 
   ne hadde soothly knowen therbifoore 
  690 that parfitly hir children loved she
  
   he wolde have wend that of som subtiltee
  
   and of malice
  or for crueel corage
  
   that she hadde suffred this with sad visage
  
   but wel he knew that next hymself
  certayn
  
   she loved hir children best in every wyse
  
   but now of wommen wolde i axen fayn 
   if thise assayes myghte nat suffise
  
   what koude a sturdy housbonde moore devyse 
   to preeve hir wyfhod and hir stedefastnesse
  
  700 and he continuynge evere in sturdinesse
  
   but ther been folk of swich condicion 
   that whan they have a certein purpos take
  
   they kan nat stynte of hire entencion
  
   but
  right as they were bounden to that stake
  
   they wol nat of that firste purpos slake
  
   right so this markys fulliche hath purposed 
   to tempte his wyf as he was first disposed
  
   he waiteth if by word or contenance 
   that she to hym was changed of corage
  
  710 but nevere koude he fynde variance
  
   she was ay oon in herte and in visage
  
   and ay the forther that she was in age
  
   the moore trewe
  if that it were possible
  
   she was to hym in love
  and moore penyble
  
   for which it semed thus
  that of hem two 
   ther nas but o wyl
  for as walter leste
  
   the same lust was hire plesance also
  
   and
  god be thanked
  al fil for the beste
  
   she shewed wel
  for no worldly unreste 
  720 a wyf
  as of hirself
  nothing ne sholde 
   wille in effect
  but as hir housbonde wolde
  
   the sclaundre of walter ofte and wyde spradde
  
   that of a crueel herte he wikkedly
  
   for he a povre womman wedded hadde
  
   hath mordred bothe his children prively
  
   swich murmur was among hem comunly
  
   no wonder is
  for to the peples ere 
   ther cam no word but that they mordred were
  
   for which
  where as his peple therbifore 
  730 hadde loved hym wel
  the sclaundre of his diffame 
   made hem that they hym hatede therfore
  
   to been a mordrere is an hateful name
  
   but nathelees
  for ernest ne for game
  
   he of his crueel purpos nolde stente
  
   to tempte his wyf was set al his entente
  
   whan that his doghter twelve yeer was of age
  
   he to the court of rome
  in subtil wyse 
   enformed of his wyl
  sente his message
  
   comaundynge hem swiche bulles to devyse 
  740 as to his crueel purpos may suffyse    
   how that the pope
  as for his peples reste
  
   bad hym to wedde another
  if hym leste
  
   i seye
  he bad they sholde countrefete 
   the popes bulles
  makynge mencion 
   that he hath leve his firste wyf to lete
  
   as by the popes dispensacion
  
   to stynte rancour and dissencion 
   bitwixe his peple and hym
  thus seyde the bulle
  
   the which they han publiced atte fulle
  
  750 the rude peple
  as it no wonder is
  
   wenden ful wel that it hadde be right so
  
   but whan thise tidynges came to grisildis
  
   i deeme that hire herte was ful wo
  
   but she
  ylike sad for everemo
  
   disposed was
  this humble creature
  
   the adversitee of fortune al t  endure
  
   abidynge evere his lust and his plesance
  
   to whom that she was yeven herte and al
  
   as to hire verray worldly suffisance
  
  760 but shortly if this storie i tellen shal
  
   this markys writen hath in special 
   a lettre
  in which he sheweth his entente
  
   and secreely he to boloigne it sente
  
   to the erl of panyk
  which that hadde tho 
   wedded his suster
  preyde he specially 
   to bryngen hoom agayn his children two 
   in honurable estaat al openly
  
   but o thyng he hym preyede outrely
  
   that he to no wight
  though men wolde enquere
  
  770 sholde nat telle whos children that they were
  
   but seye the mayden sholde ywedded be 
   unto the markys of saluce anon
  
   and as this erl was preyed
  so dide he
  
   for at day set he on his wey is goon

   and thus in greet noblesse and with glad cheere
  
   toward saluces shapynge hir journey
  
   fro day to day they ryden in hir wey
  
   among al this
  after his wikke usage

   to the outtreste preeve of hir corage
  
   fully to han experience and loore 
   if that she were as stidefast as bifoore

   but yet i hope it be nat youre entente 
   that i smoklees out of youre paleys wente
  
   
 ye koude nat doon so dishonest a thyng
  
   that thilke wombe in which youre children leye 
   sholde biforn the peple

  880 lat me nat lyk a worm go by the weye
  
   remembre yow
  myn owene lord so deere
  
   i was youre wyf

   that i therwith may wrye the wombe of here 
   that was youre wyf

  890 
 the smok
 
  quod he
  
 that thou hast on thy bak
  
   lat it be stille
  and bere it forth with thee
 
  
   but wel unnethes thilke word he spak
  
   but wente his wey
  for routhe and for pitee
  
   biforn the folk hirselven strepeth she
  
   and in hir smok
  with heed and foot al bare
  
   toward hir fadre hous forth is she fare
  
   the folk hire folwe
  wepynge in hir weye
  
   and fortune ay they cursen as they goon
  
   but she fro wepyng kepte hire eyen dreye
  
  900 ne in this tyme word ne spak she noon
  
   hir fader
  that this tidynge herde anoon
  
   curseth the day and tyme that nature 
   shoop hym to been a lyves creature
  
   for out of doute this olde poure man 
   was evere in suspect of hir mariage
  
   for evere he demed
  sith that it bigan
  
   that whan the lord fulfild hadde his corage
  
   hym wolde thynke it were a disparage 
   to his estaat so lowe for t  alighte
  
  910 and voyden hire as soone as ever he myghte
  
   agayns his doghter hastily goth he
  
   for he by noyse of folk knew hire comynge
  
   and with hire olde coote
  as it myghte be 
   he covered hire
  ful sorwefully wepynge
  
   but on hire body myghte he it nat brynge
  
   for rude was the clooth
  and moore of age 
   by dayes fele than at hire mariage
