 whilom ther was dwellynge at oxenford 
   a riche gnof
  that gestes heeld to bord
  
   and of his craft he was a carpenter
  
  3190 with hym ther was dwellynge a poure scoler
  
   hadde lerned art
  but al his fantasye 
   was turned for to lerne astrologye
  
   and koude a certeyn of conclusiouns
  
   to demen by interrogaciouns
  
   if that men asked hym
  in certein houres 
   whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures
  
   or if men asked hym what sholde bifalle 
   of every thyng
  i may nat rekene hem alle
  
   this clerk was cleped hende nicholas
  
  3200 of deerne love he koude and of solas
  
   and therto he was sleigh and ful privee
  
   and lyk a mayden meke for to see
  
   a chambre hadde he in that hostelrye 
   allone
  withouten any compaignye
  
   ful fetisly ydight with herbes swoote
  
   and he hymself as sweete as is the roote 
   of lycorys or any cetewale
  
   his almageste
  and bookes grete and smale
  
   his astrelabie
  longynge for his art
  
  3210 his augrym stones layen faire apart
  
   on shelves couched at his beddes heed
  
   his presse ycovered with a faldyng reed
  
   and al above ther lay a gay sautrie
  
   on which he made a nyghtes melodie 
   so swetely that all the chambre rong
  
   and angelus ad virginem he song
  
   and after that he song the kynges noote
  
   ful often blessed was his myrie throte
  
   and thus this sweete clerk his tyme spente 
  3220 after his freendes fyndyng and his rente
  
   this carpenter hadde wedded newe a wyf
  
   which that he lovede moore than his lyf
  
   of eighteteene yeer she was of age
  
   jalous he was
  and heeld hire narwe in cage
  
   for she was wylde and yong
  and he was old 
   and demed hymself been lik a cokewold
  
   he knew nat catoun
  for his wit was rude
  
   that bad man sholde wedde his simylitude
  
   men sholde wedden after hire estaat
  
  3230 for youthe and elde is often at debaat
  
   but sith that he was fallen in the snare
  
   he moste endure
  as oother folk
  his care
  
   fair was this yonge wyf
  and therwithal 
   as any wezele hir body gent and smal
  
   a ceynt she werede

   ful smale ypulled were hire browes two
  
   and tho were bent and blake as any sloo
  
   she was ful moore blisful on to see 
   than is the newe pere jonette tree
  
   and softer than the wolle is of a wether
  
  3250 and by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether
  
   tasseled with silk and perled with latoun
  
   in al this world
  to seken up and doun
  
   there nys no man so wys that koude thenche 
   so gay a popelote or swich a wenche
  
   ful brighter was the shynyng of hir hewe 
   than in the tour the noble yforged newe
  
   but of hir song
  it was as loude and yerne 
   as any swalwe sittynge on a berne
  
   therto she koude skippe and make game

   a brooch she baar upon hir lowe coler
  
   as brood as is the boos of a bokeler
  
   hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye
  
   she was a prymerole
  a piggesnye
  
   for any lord to leggen in his bedde
  
  3270 or yet for any good yeman to wedde

 yis
  god woot
  john
  i heere it every deel
 
  
  3370 this passeth forth
  what wol ye bet than weel
  
   fro day to day this joly absolon 
   so woweth hire that hym is wo bigon
  
   he waketh al the nyght and al the day
  
   he kembeth his lokkes brode
  and made hym gay

   somtyme
  to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye
  
   he pleyeth herodes upon a scaffold hye
  
   but what availleth hym as in this cas
  
   she loveth so this hende nicholas 
   that absolon may blowe the bukkes horn
  
   he ne hadde for his labour but a scorn
  
   and thus she maketh absolon hire ape
  
  3390 and al his ernest turneth til a jape
  
   ful sooth is this proverbe
  it is no lye
  
   men seyn right thus
  
 alwey the nye slye 
   maketh the ferre leeve to be looth
 
  
   for though that absolon be wood or wrooth
  
   by cause that he fer was from hire sight
  
   this nye nicholas stood in his light
  
   now ber thee wel
