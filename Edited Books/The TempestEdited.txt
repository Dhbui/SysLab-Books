  indian
  legged like a man

   there be some sports are painful
  and their labour 
  delight in them sets off
  some kinds of baseness 
  are nobly undergone
  and most poor matters 
  point to rich ends

  would be as heavy to me as odious
  but                               5 
  the mistress which i serve quickens what s dead
  
  and makes my labours pleasures
  o
  she is 
  ten times more gentle than her father s crabbed
  
  and he s composed of harshness
  i must remove 
  some thousands of these logs
  and pile them up
                      10 
  upon a sore injunction
  my sweet mistress 
  weeps when she sees me work
  and says
  such baseness 
  had never like executor
  i forget
  
  but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours
  
  most busy lest
  when i do it

  i would the lightning had 
  burnt up those logs that you are enjoin d to pile

  brought my too diligent ear
  for several virtues 
  have i liked several women

  with so full soul
  but some defect in her 
  did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
                         45

  so perfect and so peerless
