   that by the same ensample taughte he me 
   that i ne sholde wedded be but ones
  
   herkne eek
  lo
  which a sharp word for the nones
  
   biside a welle
  jhesus

   is noght thyn housbonde
   thus seyde he certeyn
  
  20 what that he mente therby
  i kan nat seyn
  
   but that i axe
  why that the fifthe man 
   was noon housbonde to the samaritan
  
   how manye myghte she have in mariage
  
   yet herde i nevere tellen in myn age 
   upon this nombre diffinicioun
  
   men may devyne and glosen
  up and doun
  
   but wel i woot
  expres
  withoute lye
  
   god bad us for to wexe and multiplye
  
   that gentil text kan i wel understonde
  
  30 eek wel i woot
  he seyde myn housbonde 
   sholde lete fader and mooder and take to me
  
   but of no nombre mencion made he
  
   of bigamye
  or of octogamye
  
   why sholde men thanne speke of it vileynye
  
   lo
  heere the wise kyng
  daun salomon
  
   i trowe he hadde wyves mo than oon
  
   as wolde god it leveful were unto me 
   to be refresshed half so ofte as he
  
   which yifte of god hadde he for alle his wyvys
  
  40 no man hath swich that in this world alyve is
  
   god woot
  this noble kyng
  as to my wit
  
   the firste nyght had many a myrie fit 
   with ech of hem
  so wel was hym on lyve
  
   yblessed be god that i have wedded fyve
  
    of whiche i have pyked out the beste
  
   bothe of here nether purs and of here cheste
  
   diverse scoles maken parfyt clerkes
  
   and diverse practyk in many sondry werkes 
   maketh the werkman parfyt sekirly
  
   of fyve husbondes scoleiyng am i
   
   welcome the sixte
  whan that evere he shal
  
   for sothe
  i wol nat kepe me chaast in al
  
   whan myn housbonde is fro the world ygon
  
   som cristen man shal wedde me anon
  
   for thanne th  apostle seith that i am free 
  50 to wedde
  a goddes half
  where it liketh me
  
   he seith that to be wedded is no synne
  
   bet is to be wedded than to brynne
  
   what rekketh me
  thogh folk seye vileynye 
   of shrewed lameth and his bigamye
  
   i woot wel abraham was an hooly man
  
   and jacob eek
  as ferforth as i kan
  
   and ech of hem hadde wyves mo than two
  
   and many another holy man also
  
   wher can ye seye
  in any manere age
  
  60 that hye god defended mariage 
   by expres word
  i pray yow
  telleth me
  
   or where comanded he virginitee
  
   i woot as wel as ye
  it is no drede
  
   th  apostel
  whan he speketh of maydenhede
  
   he seyde that precept therof hadde he noon
  
   men may conseille a womman to been oon
  
   but conseillyng is no comandement
  
   he putte it in oure owene juggement
  
   for hadde god comanded maydenhede
  
  70 thanne hadde he dampned weddyng with the dede
  
   and certes
  if ther were no seed ysowe
  
   virginitee
  thanne wherof sholde it growe
  
   poul dorste nat comanden
  atte leeste
  
   a thyng of which his maister yaf noon heeste
  
   the dart is set up for virginitee
  
   cacche whoso may
  who renneth best lat see
  
   but this word is nat taken of every wight
  
   but ther as god lust gyve it of his myght
  
   i woot wel that th  apostel was a mayde
  
  80 but nathelees
  thogh that he wroot and sayde 
   he wolde that every wight were swich as he
  
   al nys but conseil to virginitee
  
   and for to been a wyf he yaf me leve 
   of indulgence
  so nys it no repreve 
   to wedde me
  if that my make dye
  
   withouten excepcion of bigamye
  
   al were it good no womman for to touche    
   he mente as in his bed or in his couche
  
   for peril is bothe fyr and tow t  assemble
  
  90 ye knowe what this ensample may resemble
  
   this is al and som
  he heeld virginitee 
   moore parfit than weddyng in freletee
  
   freletee clepe i
  but if that he and she 
   wolde leden al hir lyf in chastitee
  
   i graunte it wel
  i have noon envie
  
   thogh maydenhede preferre bigamye
  
   it liketh hem to be clene
  body and goost
  
   of myn estaat i nyl nat make no boost
  
   for wel ye knowe
  a lord in his houshold
  
  100 he nath nat every vessel al of gold
  
   somme been of tree
  and doon hir lord servyse
  
   god clepeth folk to hym in sondry wyse
  
   and everich hath of god a propre yifte    
   som this
  som that
  as hym liketh shifte
  
   virginitee is greet perfeccion
  
   and continence eek with devocion
  
   but crist
  that of perfeccion is welle
  
   bad nat every wight he sholde go selle 
   al that he hadde
  and gyve it to the poore
  
  110 and in swich wise folwe hym and his foore
  
   he spak to hem that wolde lyve parfitly
  
   and lordynges
  by youre leve
  that am nat i
  
   i wol bistowe the flour of al myn age 
   in the actes and in fruyt of mariage
  
   telle me also
  to what conclusion 
   were membres maad of generacion
  
   and of so parfit wys a  wright  ywroght
  
   trusteth right wel
  they were nat maad for noght
  
   glose whoso wole
  and seye bothe up and doun 
  120 that they were maked for purgacioun 
   of uryne
  and oure bothe thynges smale 
   were eek to knowe a femele from a male
  
   and for noon oother cause    say ye no
  
   the experience woot wel it is noght so
  
   so that the clerkes be nat with me wrothe
  
   i sey this
  that they maked ben for bothe
  
   that is to seye
  for office and for ese 
   of engendrure
  ther we nat god displese
  
   why sholde men elles in hir bookes sette 
  130 that man shal yelde to his wyf hire dette
  
   now wherwith sholde he make his paiement
  
   if he ne used his sely instrument
  
   thanne were they maad upon a creature 
   to purge uryne
  and eek for engendrure
  
   but i seye noght that every wight is holde
  
   that hath swich harneys as i to yow tolde
  
   to goon and usen hem in engendrure
  
   thanne sholde men take of chastitee no cure
  
   crist was a mayde and shapen as a man
  
  140 and many a seint
  sith that the world bigan
  
   yet lyved they evere in parfit chastitee
  
   i nyl envye no virginitee
  
   lat hem be breed of pured whete seed
  
   and lat us wyves hoten barly breed
  
   and yet with barly breed
  mark telle kan
  
   oure lord jhesu refresshed many a man
  
   in swich estaat as god hath cleped us 
   i wol persevere
  i nam nat precius
  
   in wyfhod i wol use myn instrument 
  150 as frely as my makere hath it sent
  
   if i be daungerous
  god yeve me sorwe
  
   myn housbonde shal it have bothe eve and morwe
  
   whan that hym list come forth and paye his dette
  
   an housbonde i wol have    i wol nat lette    
   which shal be bothe my dettour and my thral
  
   and have his tribulacion withal 
   upon his flessh
  whil that i am his wyf
  
   i have the power durynge al my lyf 
   upon his propre body
  and noght he
  
  160 right thus the apostel tolde it unto me
  
   and bad oure housbondes for to love us weel
  
   al this sentence me liketh every deel
     
   up stirte the pardoner
  and that anon

  380 baar i stifly myne olde housbondes on honde 
   that thus they seyden in hir dronkenesse
  
   and al was fals

   o lord
  the peyne i dide hem and the wo

   of thyng of which they nevere agilte hir lyve
  
   of wenches wolde i beren hem on honde
  
   whan that for syk unnethes myghte they stonde
  
   yet tikled i his herte
  for that he 
   wende that i hadde of hym so greet chiertee
  
   i swoor that al my walkynge out by nyghte 
   was for t  espye wenches that he dighte
  
   under that colour hadde i many a myrthe

   atte ende i hadde the bettre in ech degree
  
   by sleighte
  or force
  or by som maner thyng
  
   as by continueel murmur or grucchyng
  
   namely abedde hadden they meschaunce

   thanne wolde i suffre hym do his nycetee
  
   and therfore every man this tale i telle
  
   wynne whoso may
  for al is for to selle
  
   with empty hand men may none haukes lure
  
   for wynnyng wolde i al his lust endure
  
   and make me a feyned appetit

   as helpe me verray god omnipotent
  
   though i right now sholde make my testament
  
   i ne owe hem nat a word that it nys quit
  
   i broghte it so aboute by my wit 
   that they moste yeve it up
  as for the beste
  
   or elles hadde we nevere been in reste

   my fourthe housbonde was a revelour    
   this is to seyn
  he hadde a paramour    
   and i was yong and ful of ragerye
  
   stibourn and strong
  and joly as a pye
  
   how koude i daunce to an harpe smale

   in wommen vinolent is no defence    
   this knowen lecchours by experience
  
   but    lord crist
     whan that it remembreth me 
  470 upon my yowthe
  and on my jolitee
  
   it tikleth me aboute myn herte roote
  
   unto this day it dooth myn herte boote 
   that i have had my world as in my tyme
  
   but age
  allas
  that al wole envenyme
  
   hath me biraft my beautee and my pith

   the flour is goon

   but yet to be right myrie wol i fonde
  
  480 now wol i tellen of my fourthe housbonde
  
   i seye
  i hadde in herte greet despit 
   that he of any oother had delit
  
   but he was quit
  by god and by seint joce
  
   i made hym of the same wode a croce
  
   nat of my body
  in no foul manere
  
   but certeinly
  i made folk swich cheere 
   that in his owene grece i made hym frye 
   for angre
  and for verray jalousye
  
   by god
  in erthe i was his purgatorie
  
  490 for which i hope his soule be in glorie
  
   for
  god it woot
  he sat ful ofte and song
  
   whan that his shoo ful bitterly hym wrong
  
   ther was no wight
  save god and he
  that wiste
  
   in many wise
  how soore i hym twiste
  
   he deyde whan i cam fro jerusalem
  
   and lith ygrave under the roode beem
  
   al is his tombe noght so curyus 
   as was the sepulcre of hym daryus
  
   which that appelles wroghte subtilly
  
  500 it nys but wast to burye hym preciously
  
   lat hym fare wel
  god yeve his soule reste
  
   he is now in his grave and in his cheste
  
   now of my fifthe housbonde wol i telle
  
   god lete his soule nevere come in helle
  
   and yet was he to me the mooste shrewe
  
   that feele i on my ribbes al by rewe
  
   and evere shal unto myn endyng day
  
   but in oure bed he was so fressh and gay
  
   and therwithal so wel koude he me glose
  
  510 whan that he wolde han my bele chose
  
   that thogh he hadde me bete on every bon
  
   he koude wynne agayn my love anon
  
   i trowe i loved hym best
  for that he 
   was of his love daungerous to me
  
   we wommen han
  if that i shal nat lye
  
   in this matere a queynte fantasye
  
   wayte what thyng we may nat lightly have
  
   therafter wol we crie al day and crave

   greet prees at market maketh deere ware
  
   and to greet cheep is holde at litel prys
  
   this knoweth every womman that is wys
  
   my fifthe housbonde    god his soule blesse
     
   which that i took for love
  and no richesse
  
   he som tyme was a clerk of oxenford
  
   and hadde left scole
  and wente at hom to bord

   for hadde myn housbonde pissed on a wal
  
   or doon a thyng that sholde han cost his lyf
  
   to hire
  and to another worthy wyf
  
   and to my nece
  which that i loved weel
  
   i wolde han toold his conseil every deel
  
   and so i dide ful often
  god it woot
  
  540 that made his face often reed and hoot 
   for verray shame
  and blamed hymself for he 
   had toold to me so greet a pryvetee
  
   and so bifel that ones in a lente    
   so often tymes i to my gossyb wente
  
   for evere yet i loved to be gay
  
   and for to walke in march
  averill

   fro hous to hous
  to heere sondry talys    
   that jankyn clerk
  and my gossyb dame alys
  
   and i myself
  into the feeldes wente
  
  550 myn housbonde was at londoun al that lente
  
   i hadde the bettre leyser for to pleye
  
   and for to se
  and eek for to be seye 
   of lusty folk
  what wiste i wher my grace 
   was shapen for to be
  or in what place
  
   therfore i made my visitaciouns 
   to vigilies and to processiouns
  
   to prechyng eek
  and to thise pilgrimages
  
   to pleyes of myracles
  and to mariages
  
   and wered upon my gaye scarlet gytes
  
  560 thise wormes
  ne thise motthes
  ne thise mytes
  
   upon my peril
  frete hem never a deel
  
   and wostow why
  for they were used weel
  
   now wol i tellen forth what happed me
  
   i seye that in the feeldes walked we
  
   til trewely we hadde swich daliance
  
   this clerk and i
  that of my purveiance 
   i spak to hym and seyde hym how that he
  
   if i were wydwe
  sholde wedde me
  
   for certeinly    i sey for no bobance    
  570 yet was i nevere withouten purveiance 
   of mariage
  n  of othere thynges eek
  
   i holde a mouses herte nat worth a leek 
   that hath but oon hole for to sterte to
  
   and if that faille
  thanne is al ydo
  
   i bar hym on honde he hadde enchanted me    
   my dame taughte me that soutiltee    
   and eek i seyde i mette of hym al nyght
  
   he wolde han slayn me as i lay upright
  
   and al my bed was ful of verray blood
  
  580  but yet i hope that ye shal do me good
  
   for blood bitokeneth gold
  as me was taught
   
   and al was fals
  i dremed of it right naught
  
   but as i folwed ay my dames loore
  
   as wel of this as of othere thynges moore
  
   but now
  sire
  lat me se what i shal seyn
  
   a ha
  by god
  i have my tale ageyn
  
   whan that my fourthe housbonde was on beere
  
   i weep algate
  and made sory cheere
  
   as wyves mooten
  for it is usage
  
  590 and with my coverchief covered my visage
  
   but for that i was purveyed of a make
  
   i wepte but smal
  and that i undertake
  
   to chirche was myn housbonde born a morwe 
   with neighebores
  that for hym maden sorwe
  
   and jankyn
  oure clerk
  was oon of tho
  
   as help me god
  whan that i saugh hym go 
   after the beere
  me thoughte he hadde a paire 
   of legges and of feet so clene and faire 
   that al myn herte i yaf unto his hoold
  
  600 he was
  i trowe
  twenty wynter oold
  
   and i was fourty
  if i shal seye sooth
  
   but yet i hadde alwey a coltes tooth
  
   gat tothed i was
  and that bicam me weel
  
   i hadde the prente of seinte venus seel
  
   as help me god
  i was a lusty oon
  
   and faire
  and riche
  and yong
  and wel bigon
  
   and trewely
  as myne housbondes tolde me
  
   i hadde the beste quoniam myghte be
  
   for certes
  i am al venerien 
  610 in feelynge
  and myn herte is marcien
  
   venus me yaf my lust
  my likerousnesse
  
   and mars yaf me my sturdy hardynesse
  
   myn ascendent was taur
  and mars therinne
  
   allas
  allas
  that evere love was synne
  
   i folwed ay myn inclinacioun 
   by vertu of my constellacioun
  
   that made me i koude noght withdrawe 
   my chambre of venus from a good felawe
  
   yet have i martes mark upon my face
  
  620 and also in another privee place
  
   for god so wys be my savacioun
  
   i ne loved nevere by no discrecioun
  
   but evere folwede myn appetit
  
   al were he short
  or long
  or blak
  or whit
  
   i took no kep
  so that he liked me
  
   how poore he was
  ne eek of what degree
  
   what sholde i seye but
  at the monthes ende
  
   this joly clerk
  jankyn
  that was so hende
  
   hath wedded me with greet solempnytee
  
  630 and to hym yaf i al the lond and fee 
   that evere was me yeven therbifoore
  
   but afterward repented me ful soore
  
   he nolde suffre nothyng of my list
  
   by god
  he smoot me ones on the lyst
  
   for that i rente out of his book a leef
  
   that of the strook myn ere wax al deef
  
   stibourn i was as is a leonesse
  
   and of my tonge a verray jangleresse
  
   and walke i wolde
  as i had doon biforn
  
  640 from hous to hous
  although he had it sworn
  
   for which he often tymes wolde preche
  
   and me of olde romayn geestes teche
  
   how he symplicius gallus lefte his wyf
  
   and hire forsook for terme of al his lyf
  
   noght but for open heveded he hir say 
   lookynge out at his dore upon a day
  
   another romayn tolde he me by name
  
   that
  for his wyf was at a someres game 
   withouten his wityng
  he forsook hire eke
  
  650 and thanne wolde he upon his bible seke 
   that ilke proverbe of ecclesiaste 
   where he comandeth and forbedeth faste 
   man shal nat suffre his wyf go roule aboute
  
   thanne wolde he seye right thus
  withouten doute
  
    whoso that buyldeth his hous al of salwes
  
   and priketh his blynde hors over the falwes
  
   and suffreth his wyf to go seken halwes
  
   is worthy to been hanged on the galwes
   
   but al for noght
  i sette noght an hawe 
  660 of his proverbes n  of his olde sawe
  
   ne i wolde nat of hym corrected be
  
   i hate hym that my vices telleth me
  
   and so doo mo
  god woot
  of us than i
  
   this made hym with me wood al outrely
  
   i nolde noght forbere hym in no cas
  
   now wol i seye yow sooth
  by seint thomas
  
   why that i rente out of his book a leef
  
   for which he smoot me so that i was deef
  
   he hadde a book that gladly
  nyght and day
  
  670 for his desport he wolde rede alway
  
   he cleped it valerie and theofraste
  
   at which book he lough alwey ful faste
  
   and eek ther was somtyme a clerk at rome
  
   a cardinal
  that highte seint jerome
  
   that made a book agayn jovinian
  
   in which book eek ther was tertulan
  
   crisippus
  trotula
  and helowys
  
   that was abbesse nat fer fro parys
  
   and eek the parables of salomon
  
  680 ovides art
  and bookes many on
  
   and alle thise were bounden in o volume
  
   and every nyght and day was his custume
  
   whan he hadde leyser and vacacioun 
   from oother worldly occupacioun
  
   to reden on this book of wikked wyves
  
   he knew of hem mo legendes and lyves 
   than been of goode wyves in the bible
  
   for trusteth wel
  it is an impossible 
   that any clerk wol speke good of wyves
  
  690 but if it be of hooly seintes lyves
  
   ne of noon oother womman never the mo
  
   who peyntede the leon
  tel me who
  
   by god
  if wommen hadde writen stories
  
   as clerkes han withinne hire oratories
  
   they wolde han writen of men moore wikkednesse 
   than al the mark of adam may redresse
  
   the children of mercurie and of venus 
   been in hir wirkyng ful contrarius
  
   mercurie loveth wysdam and science
  
  700 and venus loveth ryot and dispence
  
   and
  for hire diverse disposicioun
  
   ech falleth in otheres exaltacioun
  
   and thus
  god woot
  mercurie is desolat 
   in pisces
  wher venus is exaltat
  
   and venus falleth ther mercurie is reysed
  
   therfore no womman of no clerk is preysed
  
   the clerk
  whan he is oold
  and may noght do 
   of venus werkes worth his olde sho
  
   thanne sit he doun
  and writ in his dotage 
  710 that wommen kan nat kepe hir mariage
  
   but now to purpos
  why i tolde thee 
   that i was beten for a book
  pardee
  
   upon a nyght jankyn
  that was oure sire
  
   redde on his book
  as he sat by the fire
  
   of eva first
  that for hir wikkednesse 
   was al mankynde broght to wrecchednesse
  
   for which that jhesu crist hymself was slayn
  
   that boghte us with his herte blood agayn
  
   lo
  heere expres of womman may ye fynde 
  720 that womman was the los of al mankynde
  
   tho redde he me how sampson loste his heres
  
   slepynge
  his lemman kitte it with hir sheres
  
   thurgh which treson loste he bothe his yen
  
   tho redde he me
  if that i shal nat lyen
  
   of hercules and of his dianyre
  
   that caused hym to sette hymself afyre
  
   no thyng forgat he the care and the wo 
   that socrates hadde with his wyves two
  
   how xantippa caste pisse upon his heed
  
  730 this sely man sat stille as he were deed
  
   he wiped his heed
  namoore dorste he seyn
  
   but  er that thonder stynte
  comth a reyn
   
   of phasipha
  that was the queene of crete
  
   for shrewednesse
  hym thoughte the tale swete
  
   fy
  spek namoore    it is a grisly thyng    
   of hire horrible lust and hir likyng
  
   of clitermystra
  for hire lecherye
  
   that falsly made hire housbonde for to dye
  
   he redde it with ful good devocioun
  
  740 he tolde me eek for what occasioun 
   amphiorax at thebes loste his lyf
  
   myn housbonde hadde a legende of his wyf
  
   eriphilem
  that for an ouche of gold 
   hath prively unto the grekes told 
   wher that hir housbonde hidde hym in a place
  
   for which he hadde at thebes sory grace
  
   of lyvia tolde he me
  and of lucye
  
   they bothe made hir housbondes for to dye
  
   that oon for love
  that oother was for hate
  
  750 lyvia hir housbonde
  on an even late
  
   empoysoned hath
  for that she was his fo
  
   lucia
  likerous
  loved hire housbonde so 
   that
  for he sholde alwey upon hire thynke
  
   she yaf hym swich a manere love drynke 
   that he was deed er it were by the morwe
  
   and thus algates housbondes han sorwe
  
   thanne tolde he me how oon latumyus 
   compleyned unto his felawe arrius 
   that in his gardyn growed swich a tree 
  760 on which he seyde how that his wyves thre 
   hanged hemself for herte despitus
  
    o leeve brother
   quod this arrius
  
    yif me a plante of thilke blissed tree
  
   and in my gardyn planted shal it bee
   
   of latter date
  of wyves hath he red 
   that somme han slayn hir housbondes in hir bed
  
   and lete hir lecchour dighte hire al the nyght
  
   whan that the corps lay in the floor upright
  
   and somme han dryve nayles in hir brayn
  
  770 whil that they slepte
  and thus they had hem slayn
  
   somme han hem yeve poysoun in hire drynke
  
   he spak moore harm than herte may bithynke
  
   and therwithal he knew of mo proverbes 
   than in this world ther growen gras or herbes
  
    bet is
   quod he
   thyn habitacioun 
   be with a leon or a foul dragoun
  
   than with a womman usynge for to chyde
  
   bet is
   quod he
   hye in the roof abyde
  
   than with an angry wyf doun in the hous
  
  780 they been so wikked and contrarious
  
   they haten that hir housbondes loven ay
   
   he seyde
   a womman cast hir shame away
  
   whan she cast of hir smok 
  and forthermo
  
    a fair womman
  but she be chaast also
  
   is lyk a gold ryng in a sowes nose
   
   who wolde wene
  or who wolde suppose
  
   the wo that in myn herte was
  and pyne
  
   and whan i saugh he wolde nevere fyne 
   to reden on this cursed book al nyght
  
  790 al sodeynly thre leves have i plyght 
   out of his book
  right as he radde
  and eke 
   i with my fest so took hym on the cheke 
   that in oure fyr he fil bakward adoun
  
   and he up stirte as dooth a wood leoun
  
   and with his fest he smoot me on the heed 
   that in the floor i lay as i were deed
  
   and whan he saugh how stille that i lay
  
   he was agast and wolde han fled his way
  
   til atte laste out of my swogh i breyde
  
  800  o

  false theef
   i seyde
  
    and for my land thus hastow mordred me
  
   er i be deed
  yet wol i kisse thee
   
   and neer he cam
  and kneled faire adoun
  
   and seyde
   deere suster alisoun
  
   as help me god
  i shal thee nevere smyte
  
   that i have doon
  it is thyself to wyte
  
   foryeve it me

  and of his hond also
  
   and made hym brenne his book anon right tho
  
   and whan that i hadde geten unto me
  
   by maistrie
  al the soveraynetee
  
   and that he seyde

   after that day we hadden never debaat
