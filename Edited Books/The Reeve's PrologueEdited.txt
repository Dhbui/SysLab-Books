 whan folk hadde laughen at this nyce cas 
   of absolon and hende nicholas
  
   diverse folk diversely they seyde
  
   but for the moore part they loughe and pleyde
  
   ne at this tale i saugh no man hym greve
  
  3860 but it were oonly osewold the reve
  
   by cause he was of carpenteris craft
  
   a litel ire is in his herte ylaft
  
   he gan to grucche
  and blamed it a lite
  
   
 so theek
 
  quod he
  
 ful wel koude i thee quite 
   with bleryng of a proud milleres ye
  
   if that me liste speke of ribaudye
  
   but ik am oold
  me list not pley for age
  
   gras tyme is doon
  my fodder is now forage
  
   this white top writeth myne olde yeris
  
  3870 myn herte is also mowled as myne heris
  
   but if i fare as dooth an open ers    
   that ilke fruyt is ever lenger the wers
  
   til it be roten in mullok or in stree
  
   we olde men
  i drede
  so fare we
  
   til we be roten
  kan we nat be rype
  
   we hoppen alwey whil that the world wol pype
  
   for in oure wyl ther stiketh evere a nayl
  
   to have an hoor heed and a grene tayl
  
   as hath a leek
  for thogh oure myght be goon
  
  3880 oure wyl desireth folie evere in oon
  
   for whan we may nat doon
  than wol we speke
  
   yet in oure asshen olde is fyr yreke
  
   
 foure gleedes han we
  which i shal devyse    
   avauntyng
  liyng
  anger
  coveitise
  
   thise foure sparkles longen unto eelde
  
   oure olde lemes mowe wel been unweelde
  
   but wyl ne shal nat faillen
  that is sooth
  
   and yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth
  
   as many a yeer as it is passed henne 
  3890 syn that my tappe of lif bigan to renne
  
   for sikerly
  whan i was bore
  anon 
   deeth drough the tappe of lyf and leet it gon
  
   and ever sithe hath so the tappe yronne 
   til that almoost al empty is the tonne
  
   the streem of lyf now droppeth on the chymbe
  
   the sely tonge may wel rynge and chymbe 
   of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yoore
  
   with olde folk
  save dotage
  is namoore
 
  
   whan that oure hoost hadde herd this sermonyng
  
  3900 he gan to speke as lordly as a kyng
  
   he seide
  
 what amounteth al this wit
  
   what shul we speke alday of hooly writ
  
   the devel made a reve for to preche
  
   or of a soutere a shipman or a leche
  
   sey forth thy tale
  and tarie nat the tyme
  
   lo depeford
  and it is half wey pryme
  
   lo grenewych
  ther many a shrewe is inne
  
   it were al tyme thy tale to bigynne
 
  
   
 now
  sires
 
  quod this osewold the reve
  
  3910 
 i pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve
  
   thogh i answere
  and somdeel sette his howve
  
   for leveful is with force force of showve
  
   
 this dronke millere hath ytoold us heer 
   how that bigyled was a carpenteer
  
   peraventure in scorn
  for i am oon
  
   and
  by youre leve
  i shal hym quite anoon
  
   right in his cherles termes wol i speke
  
   i pray to god his nekke mote to breke
  
   he kan wel in myn eye seen a stalke
  
  3920 but in his owene he kan nat seen a balke
