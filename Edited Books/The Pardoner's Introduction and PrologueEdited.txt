   for though a man be falle in jalous rage
  
   lat maken with this water his potage
  
   and nevere shal he moore his wyf mystriste
  
  370 though he the soothe of hir defaute wiste
  
   al had she taken prestes two or thre
  
    heere is a miteyn eek

   that hath ymaked hir housbonde cokewold
  
   swich folk shal have no power ne no grace 
   to offren to my relikes in this place
  
   and whoso fyndeth hym out of swich blame
  
   he wol come up and offre a goddes name
  
   and i assoille him by the auctoritee 
   which that by bulle ygraunted was to me
   
   
 by this gaude have i wonne
  yeer by yeer
  
  390 an hundred mark sith i was pardoner
  
   i stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet
  
   and whan the lewed peple is doun yset
  
   i preche so as ye han herd bifoore 
   and telle an hundred false japes moore
  
   thanne peyne i me to strecche forth the nekke
  
   and est and west upon the peple i bekke
  
   as dooth a dowve sittynge on a berne
  
   myne handes and my tonge goon so yerne 
   that it is joye to se my bisynesse
  
  400 of avarice and of swich cursednesse 
   is al my prechyng
  for to make hem free 
   to yeven hir pens
  and namely unto me
  
   for myn entente is nat but for to wynne
  
   and nothyng for correccioun of synne
  
   i rekke nevere
  whan that they been beryed
  
   though that hir soules goon a blakeberyed
  
   for certes
  many a predicacioun 
   comth ofte tyme of yvel entencioun
  
   som for plesance of folk and flaterye
  
  410 to been avaunced by ypocrisye
  
   and som for veyne glorie
  and som for hate
  
   for whan i dar noon oother weyes debate
  
   thanne wol i stynge hym with my tonge smerte 
   in prechyng
  so that he shal nat asterte 
   to been defamed falsly
  if that he 
   hath trespased to my bretheren or to me
  
   for though i telle noght his propre name
  
   men shal wel knowe that it is the same
  
   by signes
  and by othere circumstances
  
  420 thus quyte i folk that doon us displesances
  
   thus spitte i out my venym under hewe 
   of hoolynesse
  to semen hooly and trewe
  
   
 but shortly myn entente i wol devyse
  
   i preche of no thyng but for coveityse
  
   therfore my theme is yet
  and evere was
  
   radix malorum est cupiditas
  
   thus kan i preche agayn that same vice 
   which that i use
  and that is avarice
  
   but though myself be gilty in that synne
  
  430 yet kan i maken oother folk to twynne 
   from avarice and soore to repente
  
   but that is nat my principal entente
  
   i preche nothyng but for coveitise
  
   of this mateere it oghte ynogh suffise
  
   
 thanne telle i hem ensamples many oon 
   of olde stories longe tyme agoon
  
   for lewed peple loven tales olde
  
   swiche thynges kan they wel reporte and holde
  
   what
  trowe ye
  that whiles i may preche
  
  440 and wynne gold and silver for i teche
  
   that i wol lyve in poverte wilfully
  
   nay
  nay
  i thoghte it nevere
  trewely
  
   for i wol preche and begge in sondry landes
  
   i wol nat do no labour with myne handes
  
   ne make baskettes and lyve therby
  
   by cause i wol nat beggen ydelly
  
   i wol noon of the apostles countrefete
  
   i wol have moneie
  wolle
  chese
  and whete
  
   al were it yeven of the povereste page
  
  450 or of the povereste wydwe in a village
  
   al sholde hir children sterve for famyne
  
   nay
  i wol drynke licour of the vyne 
   and have a joly wenche in every toun
  
   but herkneth
  lordynges
  in conclusioun
  
   youre likyng is that i shal telle a tale
  
   now have i dronke a draughte of corny ale
  
   by god
  i hope i shal yow telle a thyng 
   that shal by reson been at youre likyng
  
   for though myself be a ful vicious man
  
  460 a moral tale yet i yow telle kan
  
   which i am wont to preche for to wynne
  
   now hoold youre pees
  my tale i wol bigynne
