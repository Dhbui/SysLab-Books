 whilom ther was dwellynge in lumbardye 
   a worthy knyght
  that born was of pavye
  
   in which he lyved in greet prosperitee
  
   and sixty yeer a wyflees man was hee
  
   and folwed ay his bodily delyt 
  1250 on wommen
  ther as was his appetyt
  
   as doon thise fooles that been seculeer
  
   and whan that he was passed sixty yeer
  
   were it for hoolynesse or for dotage 
   i kan nat seye
  but swich a greet corage 
   hadde this knyght to been a wedded man 
   that day and nyght he dooth al that he kan 
   t  espien where he myghte wedded be
  
   preyinge oure lord to graunten him that he 
   mighte ones knowe of thilke blisful lyf 
  1260 that is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf
  
   and for to lyve under that hooly boond 
   with which that first god man and womman bond
  
   
 noon oother lyf
 
  seyde he
  
 is worth a bene
  
   for wedlok is so esy and so clene
  
   that in this world it is a paradys
 
  
   thus seyde this olde knyght
  that was so wys
  
   and certeinly
  as sooth as god is kyng
  
   to take a wyf it is a glorious thyng
  
   and namely whan a man is oold and hoor
  
  1270 thanne is a wyf the fruyt of his tresor
  
   thanne sholde he take a yong wyf and a feir
  
   on which he myghte engendren hym an heir
  
   and lede his lyf in joye and in solas
  
   where as thise bacheleris synge 
 allas
 
  
   whan that they fynden any adversitee 
   in love
  which nys but childyssh vanytee
  
   and trewely it sit wel to be so
  
   that bacheleris have often peyne and wo
  
   on brotel ground they buylde
  and brotelnesse 
  1280 they fynde whan they wene sikernesse
  
   they lyve but as a bryd or as a beest
  
   in libertee and under noon arreest
  
   ther as a wedded man in his estaat 
   lyveth a lyf blisful and ordinaat 
   under this yok of mariage ybounde
  
   wel may his herte in joy and blisse habounde
  
   for who kan be so buxom as a wyf
  
   who is so trewe
  and eek so ententyf 
   to kepe hym
  syk and hool
  as is his make
  
  1290 for wele or wo she wole hym nat forsake
  
   she nys nat wery hym to love and serve
  
   though that he lye bedrede til he sterve
  
   and yet somme clerkes seyn it nys nat so
  
   of whiche he theofraste is oon of tho
  
   what force though theofraste liste lye
  
   
 ne take no wyf
 
  quod he
  
 for housbondrye
  
   as for to spare in houshold thy dispence
  
   a trewe servant dooth moore diligence 
   thy good to kepe than thyn owene wyf
  
  1300 for she wol clayme half part al hir lyf
  
   and if thou be syk
  so god me save
  
   thy verray freendes
  or a trewe knave
  
   wol kepe thee bet than she that waiteth ay 
   after thy good and hath doon many a day
  
   and if thou take a wyf unto thyn hoold 
   ful lightly maystow been a cokewold
 
  
   this sentence
  and an hundred thynges worse
  
   writeth this man
  ther god his bones corse
  
   but take no kep of al swich vanytee
  
  1310 deffie theofraste

   this wol be doon at leyser parfitly
  
   it is no fors how longe that we pleye

  1840 ne hurte hymselven with his owene knyf
  
   for we han leve to pleye us by the lawe
 
  
   thus laboureth he til that the day gan dawe

   now wol i speke of woful damyan

   this sike damyan in venus fyr 
   so brenneth that he dyeth for desyr
  
   for which he putte his lyf in aventure
  
   no lenger myghte he in this wise endure
  
   but prively a penner gan he borwe
  
  1880 and in a lettre wroot he al his sorwe
  
   in manere of a compleynt or a lay
  
   unto his faire

   which letted hym to doon his bisynesse
  
   noon oother cause myghte make hym tarye
  
   
 that me forthynketh
 
  quod this januarie
  
   
 he is a gentil squier
  by my trouthe
  
   if that he deyde
  it were harm and routhe
  
   he is as wys
  discreet
  and as secree 
  1910 as any man i woot of his degree
  
   and therto manly
  and eek servysable
  
   and for to been a thrifty man right able
  
   but after mete
  as soone as evere i may
  
   i wol myself visite hym
  and eek may
  
   to doon hym al the confort that i kan
 
  
   and for that word hym blessed every man
  
   that of his bountee and his gentillesse 
   he wolde so conforten in siknesse 
   his squier
  for it was a gentil dede
  
  1920

   who studieth now but faire fresshe may

   were it by destynee or by aventure
  
   were it by influence or by nature
  
   or constellacion
  that in swich estaat 
  1970 the hevene stood that tyme fortunaat 
   was for to putte a bille of venus werkes    
   for alle thyng hath tyme
  as seyn thise clerkes

   i kan nat seye
  but grete god above
  
   that knoweth that noon act is causelees
  
   he deme of al
  for i wole holde my pees
  
   but sooth is this
  how that this fresshe may 
   hath take swich impression that day 
   of pitee of this sike damyan 
  1980 that from hire herte she ne dryve kan 
   the remembrance for to doon hym ese
  
   
 certeyn
 
  thoghte she
  
 whom that this thyng displese 
   i rekke noght
  for heere i hym assure 
   to love hym best of any creature
  
   though he namoore hadde than his sherte
 
  
   lo
  pitee renneth soone in gentil herte
  
   heere may ye se how excellent franchise 
   in wommen is
  whan they hem narwe avyse
  
   som tyrant is
  as ther be many oon 
  1990 that hath an herte as hard as any stoon
  
   which wolde han lat hym sterven in the place 
   wel rather than han graunted hym hire grace
  
   and hem rejoysen in hire crueel pryde
  
   and rekke nat to been an homycide
  
   this gentil may
  fulfilled of pitee
  
   right of hire hand a lettre made she
  
   in which she graunteth hym hire verray grace
  
   ther lakketh noght oonly but day and place 
   wher that she myghte unto his lust suffise
  
  2000 for it shal be right as he wole devyse
  
   and whan she saugh hir tyme
  upon a day 
   to visite this damyan gooth may
  
   and sotilly this lettre doun she threste 
   under his pilwe
  rede it if hym leste
  
   she taketh hym by the hand and harde hym twiste 
   so secrely that no wight of it wiste
  
   and bad hym been al hool
  and forth she wente 
   to januarie
  whan that he for hire sente
  
   up riseth damyan the nexte morwe
  
  2010 al passed was his siknesse and his sorwe
  
   he kembeth hym
  he preyneth hym and pyketh
  
   he dooth al that his lady lust and lyketh
  
   and eek to januarie he gooth as lowe 
   as evere dide a dogge for the bowe
  
   he is so plesant unto every man 
    for craft is al
  whoso that do it kan  
   that every wight is fayn to speke hym good
  
   and fully in his lady grace he stood
  
   thus lete i damyan aboute his nede
  
  2020 and in my tale forth i wol procede
  
   somme clerkes holden that felicitee 
   stant in delit
  and therfore certeyn he
  
   this noble januarie
  with al his myght
  
   in honest wyse
  as longeth to a knyght
  
   shoop hym to lyve ful deliciously
  
   his housynge
  his array
  as honestly 
   to his degree was maked as a kynges
  
   amonges othere of his honeste thynges
  
   he made a gardyn
  walled al with stoon
  
  2030 so fair a gardyn woot i nowher noon
  
   for
  out of doute
  i verraily suppose 
   that he that wroot the romance of the rose 
   ne koude of it the beautee wel devyse
  
   ne priapus ne myghte nat suffise
  
   though he be god of gardyns
  for to telle 
   the beautee of the gardyn and the welle 
   that stood under a laurer alwey grene
  
   ful ofte tyme he pluto and his queene
  
   proserpina
  and al hire fayerye
  
  2040 disporten hem and maken melodye 
   aboute that welle
  and daunced
  as men tolde
  
   this noble knyght
  this januarie the olde
  
   swich deyntee hath in it to walke and pleye
  
   that he wol no wight suffren bere the keye 
   save he hymself
  for of the smale wyket 
   he baar alwey of silver a clyket
  
   with which
  whan that hym leste
  he it unshette
  
   and whan he wolde paye his wyf hir dette 
   in somer seson
  thider wolde he go
  
  2050 and may his wyf
  and no wight but they two
  
   and thynges whiche that were nat doon abedde
  
   he in the gardyn parfourned hem and spedde
  
   and in this wyse
  many a murye day
  
   lyved this januarie and fresshe may
  
   but worldly joye may nat alwey dure 
   to januarie
  ne to no creature
  
   o sodeyn hap
  o thou fortune unstable
  
   lyk to the scorpion so deceyvable
  
   that flaterest with thyn heed whan thou wolt stynge
  
  2060 thy tayl is deeth
  thurgh thyn envenymynge
  
   o brotil joye
  o sweete venym queynte
  
   o monstre
  that so subtilly kanst peynte 
   thy yiftes under hewe of stidefastnesse
  
   that thou deceyvest bothe moore and lesse
  
   why hastow januarie thus deceyved
  
   that haddest hym for thy fulle freend receyved
  
   and now thou hast biraft hym bothe his yen
  
   for sorwe of which desireth he to dyen
  
   allas
  this noble januarie free
  
  2070 amydde his lust and his prosperitee
  
   is woxen blynd
  and that al sodeynly
  
   he wepeth and he wayleth pitously
  
   and therwithal the fyr of jalousie
  
   lest that his wyf sholde falle in som folye
  
   so brente his herte that he wolde fayn 
   that som man bothe hire and hym had slayn
  
   for neither after his deeth nor in his lyf 
   ne wolde he that she were love ne wyf
  
   but evere lyve as wydwe in clothes blake
  
  2080 soul as the turtle that lost hath hire make
  
   but atte laste
  after a month or tweye
  
   his sorwe gan aswage
  sooth to seye
  
   for whan he wiste it may noon oother be
  
   he paciently took his adversitee
  
   save
  out of doute
  he may nat forgoon 
   that he nas jalous everemoore in oon
  
   which jalousye it was so outrageous 
   that neither in halle
  n  yn noon oother hous
  
   ne in noon oother place
  neverthemo
  
  2090 he nolde suffre hire for to ryde or go
  
   but if that he had hond on hire alway
  
   for which ful ofte wepeth fresshe may
  
   that loveth damyan so benyngnely 
   that she moot outher dyen sodeynly 
   or elles she moot han hym as hir leste
  
   she wayteth whan hir herte wolde breste
  
   upon that oother syde damyan 
   bicomen is the sorwefulleste man 
   that evere was
  for neither nyght ne day 
  2100 ne myghte he speke a word to fresshe may
  
   as to his purpos
  of no swich mateere
  
   but if that januarie moste it heere
  
   that hadde an hand upon hire everemo
  
   but nathelees
  by writyng to and fro 
   and privee signes wiste he what she mente
  
   and she knew eek the fyn of his entente
  
   o januarie
  what myghte it thee availle
  
   thogh thou myghtest se as fer as shippes saille
  
   for as good is blynd deceyved be 
  2110 as to be deceyved whan a man may se
