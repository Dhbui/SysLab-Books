  that thre yeer was of age
  
   unto hym seyde
  
 fader
  why do ye wepe
  
   whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage
  
   is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe
  
   i am so hungry that i may nat slepe
  
   now wolde god that i myghte slepen evere
  
   thanne sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe
  
   ther is no thyng
  but breed
  that me were levere
 
  
   thus day by day this child bigan to crye
  
  2440 til in his fadres barm adoun it lay
  
   and seyde
  
 farewel
  fader
  i moot dye
 
  
   and kiste his fader
  and dyde the same day
  
   and whan the woful fader deed it say
  
   for wo his armes two he gan to byte
  
   and seyde
  
 allas
  fortune
  and weylaway
  
   thy false wheel my wo al may i wyte
 
  
   his children wende that it for hunger was 
   that he his armes gnow
  and nat for wo
  
   and seyde
  
 fader
  do nat so
  allas
  
  2450 but rather ete the flessh upon us two
  
   oure flessh thou yaf us
  take oure flessh us fro
  
   and ete ynogh
     right thus they to hym seyde
  
   and after that
  withinne a day or two
  
   they leyde hem in his lappe adoun and deyde
  
   hymself
  despeired
  eek for hunger starf
  
   thus ended is this myghty erl of pize
  
   from heigh estaat fortune awey hym carf
  
   of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffise
  
   whoso wol here it in a lenger wise
  
  2460 redeth the grete poete of ytaille 
   that highte dant
  for he kan al devyse 
   fro point to point
  nat o word wol he faille
  
   although that nero were as vicius 
   as any feend that lith ful lowe adoun
  
   yet he
  as telleth us swetonius
  
   this wyde world hadde in subjeccioun
  
   bothe est and west
   south 
  and septemtrioun
  
   of rubies
  saphires
  and of peerles white 
   were alle his clothes brouded up and doun
  
  2470 for he in gemmes greetly gan delite
  
   moore delicaat
  moore pompous of array
  
   moore proud was nevere emperour than he
  
   that ilke clooth that he hadde wered o day
  
   after that tyme he nolde it nevere see
  
   nettes of gold threed hadde he greet plentee 
   to fisshe in tybre
  whan hym liste pleye
  
   his lustes were al lawe in his decree
  
   for fortune as his freend hym wolde obeye
  
   he rome brende for his delicasie
  
  2480 the senatours he slow upon a day 
   to heere how that men wolde wepe and crie
  
   and slow his brother
  and by his suster lay
  
   his mooder made he in pitous array
  
   for he hire wombe slitte to biholde 
   where he conceyved was    so weilaway 
   that he so litel of his mooder tolde
  
   no teere out of his eyen for that sighte 
   ne cam
  but seyde
  
 a fair womman was she
 
  
   greet wonder is how that he koude or myghte 
  2490 be domesman of hire dede beautee
  
   the wyn to bryngen hym comanded he
  
   and drank anon    noon oother wo he made
  
   whan myght is joyned unto crueltee
  
   allas
  to depe wol the venym wade
  
   in yowthe a maister hadde this emperour 
   to teche hym letterure and curteisye
  
   for of moralitee he was the flour
  
   as in his tyme
  but if bookes lye
  
   and whil this maister hadde of hym maistrye
  
  2500 he maked hym so konnyng and so sowple 
   that longe tyme it was er tirannye 
   or any vice dorste on hym uncowple
  
   this seneca
  of which that i devyse
  
   by cause nero hadde of hym swich drede
  
   for he fro vices wolde hym ay chastise 
   discreetly
  as by word and nat by dede    
   
 sire
 
  wolde he seyn
  
 an emperour moot nede 
   be vertuous and hate tirannye   
  
   for which he in a bath made hym to blede 
  2510 on bothe his armes
  til he moste dye
  
   this nero hadde eek of acustumaunce 
   in youthe agayns his maister for to ryse
  
   which afterward hym thoughte a greet grevaunce
  
   therefore he made hym dyen in this wise
  
   but natheless this seneca the wise 
   chees in a bath to dye in this manere 
   rather than han another tormentise
  
   and thus hath nero slayn his maister deere
  
   now fil it so that fortune liste no lenger 
  2520 the hye pryde of nero to cherice
  
   for though that he were strong
  yet was she strenger
  
   she thoughte thus
  
 by god
  i am to nyce 
   to sette a man that is fulfild of vice 
   in heigh degree
  and emperour hym calle
  
   by god
  out of his sete i wol hym trice
  
   whan he leest weneth
  sonnest shal he falle
 
  
   the peple roos upon hym on a nyght 
   for his defaute
  and whan he it espied
  
   out of his dores anon he hath hym dight 
  2530 allone
  and ther he wende han been allied 
   he knokked faste
  and ay the moore he cried 
   the fastere shette they the dores alle
  
   tho wiste he wel
  he hadde himself mysgyed
  
   and wente his wey
  no lenger dorste he calle
  
   the peple cried and rombled up and doun
  
   that with his erys herde he how they seyde
  
   
 where is this false tiraunt
  this neroun
 
  
   for fere almoost out of his wit he breyde
  
   and to his goddes pitously he preyde 
  2540 for socour
  but it myghte nat bityde
  
   for drede of this hym thoughte that he deyde
  
   and ran into a gardyn hym to hyde
  
   and in this gardyn foond he cherles tweye 
   that seten by a fyr
  greet and reed
  
   and to thise cherles two he gan to preye 
   to sleen hym and to girden of his heed
  
   that to his body
  whan that he were deed
  
   were no despit ydoon for his defame
  
   hymself he slow
  he koude no bettre reed
  
  2550 of which fortune lough
  and hadde a game
  
   was nevere capitayn under a kyng 
   that regnes mo putte in subjeccioun
  
   ne strenger was in feeld of alle thyng
  
   as in his tyme
  ne gretter of renoun
  
   ne moore pompous in heigh presumpcioun 
   than oloferne
  which fortune ay kiste 
   so likerously
  and ladde hym up and doun 
   til that his heed was of
  er that he wiste
  
   nat oonly that this world hadde hym in awe 
  2560 for lesynge of richesse or libertee
  
   but he made every man reneyen his lawe
  
   
 nabugodonosor was god
 
  seyde hee
  
   
 noon oother god sholde adoured bee
 
  
   agayns his heeste no wight dorst trespace
  
   save in bethulia
  a strong citee
  
   where eliachim a preest was of that place
  
   but taak kep of the deth of oloferne
  
   amydde his hoost he dronke lay a nyght
  
   withinne his tente
  large as is a berne
  
  2570 and yet
  for al his pompe and al his myght
  
   judith
  a womman
  as he lay upright 
   slepynge
  his heed of smoot
  and from his tente 
   ful pryvely she stal from every wight
  
   and with his heed unto hir toun she wente
  
   what nedeth it of kyng anthiochus 
   to telle his hye roial magestee
  
   his hye pride
  his werkes venymus
  
   for swich another was ther noon as he
  
   rede which that he was in machabee
  
  2580 and rede the proude wordes that he seyde
  
   and why he fil fro heigh prosperitee
  
   and in an hill how wrecchedly he deyde
  
   fortune hym hadde enhaunced so in pride 
   that verraily he wende he myghte attayne 
   unto the sterres upon every syde
  
   and in balance weyen ech montayne
  
   and alle the floodes of the see restrayne
  
   and goddes peple hadde he moost in hate
  
   hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne
  
  2590 wenynge that god ne myghte his pride abate
  
   and for that nichanore and thymothee 
   of jewes weren venquysshed myghtily
  
   unto the jewes swich an hate hadde he 
   that he bad greithen his chaar ful hastily
  
   and swoor
  and seyde ful despitously 
   unto jerusalem he wolde eftsoone 
   to wreken his ire on it ful cruelly
  
   but of his purpos he was let ful soone
  
   god for his manace hym so soore smoot 
  2600 with invisible wounde
  ay incurable
  
   that in his guttes carf it so and boot 
   that his peynes weren importable
  
   and certeinly the wreche was resonable
  
   for many a mannes guttes dide he peyne
  
   but from his purpos cursed and dampnable
  
   for al his smert
  he wolde hym nat restreyne
  
   but bad anon apparaillen his hoost
  
   and sodeynly
  er he was of it war
  
   god daunted al his pride and al his boost
  
  2610 for he so soore fil out of his char 
   that it his limes and his skyn totar
  
   so that he neyther myghte go ne ryde
  
   but in a chayer men aboute hym bar
  
   al forbrused
  bothe bak and syde
  
   the wreche of god hym smoot so cruelly 
   that thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte
  
   and therwithal he stank so horribly 
   that noon of al his meynee that hym kepte
  
   wheither so he wook or ellis slepte
  
  2620 ne myghte noght the stynk of hym endure
  
   in this meschief he wayled and eek wepte
  
   and knew god lord of every creature
  
   to al his hoost and to hymself also 
   ful wlatsom was the stynk of his careyne
  
   no man ne myghte hym bere to ne fro
  
   and in this stynk and this horrible peyne
  
   he starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne
  
   thus hath this robbour and this homycide
  
   that many a man made to wepe and pleyne
  
  2630 swich gerdoun as bilongeth unto pryde
  
   the storie of alisaundre is so commune 
   that every wight that hath discrecioun 
   hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune
  
   this wyde world
  as in conclusioun
  
   he wan by strengthe
  or for his hye renoun 
   they weren glad for pees unto hym sende
  
   the pride of man and beest he leyde adoun
  
   wherso he cam
  unto the worldes ende
  
   comparisoun myghte nevere yet been maked 
  2640 bitwixe hym and another conquerour
  
   for al this world for drede of hym hath quaked
  
   he was of knyghthod and of fredom flour
  
   fortune hym made the heir of hire honour
  
   save wyn and wommen
  no thing myghte aswage 
   his hye entente in armes and labour
  
   so was he ful of leonyn corage

  the conquerour
  
   that wan al th  occident by land and see
  
   by strengthe of hand
  or elles by tretee
  
   and unto rome made hem tributarie
  
   and sitthe of rome the emperour was he 
   til that fortune weex his adversarie
  
   o myghty cesar
  that in thessalie 
  2680 agayn pompeus
  fader thyn in lawe
  
   that of the orient hadde al the chivalrie

   thurgh which thou puttest al th  orient in awe
  
   thanke fortune
  that so wel thee spedde
  
   but now a litel while i wol biwaille 
   this pompeus
  this noble governour 
   of rome
  which that fleigh at this bataille
  
  2690 i seye

   that fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte
  
   to rome agayn repaireth julius

   but on a tyme brutus cassius
  
   that evere hadde of his hye estaat envye
  
   ful prively hath maad conspiracye 
  2700 agayns this julius in subtil wise
  
   and caste the place in which he sholde dye 
   with boydekyns
  as i shal yow devyse
  
   this julius to the capitolie wente 
   upon a day
  as he was wont to goon
  
   and in the capitolie anon hym hente 
   this false brutus and his othere foon
  
   and stiked hym with boydekyns anoon 
   with many a wounde
  and thus they lete hym lye
  
   but nevere gronte he at no strook but oon
  
  2710 or elles at two
  but if his storie lye
  
   so manly was this julius of herte
  
   and so wel lovede estaatly honestee
  
   that though his deedly woundes soore smerte
  
   his mantel over his hypes caste he
  
   for no man sholde seen his privetee
  
   and as he lay of diyng in a traunce
  
   and wiste verraily that deed was hee
  
   of honestee yet hadde he remembraunce
  
   lucan
  to thee this storie i recomende
  
  2720 and to swetoun
  and to valerius also
  
   that of this storie writen word and ende
  
   how that to thise grete conqueroures two 
   fortune was first freend
  and sitthe foo
  
   no man ne truste upon hire favour longe
  
   but have hire in awayt for everemoo
  
   witnesse on alle thise conqueroures stronge
  
   this riche cresus
  whilom kyng of lyde
  
   of which cresus cirus soore hym dradde
  
   yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde
  
  2730 and to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde
  
   but swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde 
   that slow the fyr
  and made hym to escape
  
   but to be war no grace yet he hadde
  
   til fortune on the galwes made hym gape
  
   whanne he escaped was
  he kan nat stente 
   for to bigynne a newe werre agayn
  
   he wende wel
  for that fortune hym sente 
   swich hap that he escaped thurgh the rayn
  
   that of his foos he myghte nat be slayn
  
  2740 and eek a sweven upon a nyght he mette
  
   of which he was so proud and eek so fayn 
   that in vengeance he al his herte sette
  
   upon a tree he was
  as that hym thoughte
  
   ther juppiter hym wessh
  bothe bak and syde
  
   and phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte 
   to dryen hym with
  and therfore wax his pryde
  
   and to his doghter
  that stood hym bisyde
  
   which that he knew in heigh sentence habounde
  
   he bad hire telle hym what it signyfyde
  
  2750 and she his dreem bigan right thus expounde

   thus warned hym ful plat and ek ful pleyn 
   his doghter

   anhanged was cresus
  the proude kyng
  
  2760 his roial trone myghte hym nat availle
  
   tragedies noon oother maner thyng

   with unwar strook the regnes that been proude
  
   for whan men trusteth hire
