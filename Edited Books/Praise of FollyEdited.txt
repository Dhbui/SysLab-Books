                            erasmus of rotterdam 
                                to his friend 
                            thomas more
  health
  
   
   
  as i was coming awhile since out of italy for england
  that i might not 
  waste all that time i was to sit on horseback in foolish and illiterate 
  fables
  i chose rather one while to revolve with myself something of our 
  common studies
  and other while to enjoy the remembrance of my friends
  
  of whom i left here some no less learned than pleasant
  among these you
  
  my more
  came first in my mind
  whose memory
  though absent yourself
  
  gives me such delight in my absence
  as when present with you i ever 
  found in your company
  than which
  let me perish if in all my life i ever 
  met with anything more delectable
  and therefore
  being satisfied that 
  something was to be done
  and that that time was no wise proper for any 
  serious matter
  i resolved to make some sport with the praise of folly
  
  but who the devil put that in your head
  you ll say
  the first thing was 
  your surname of more
  which comes so near the word  moriae   folly  as 
  you are far from the thing
  and that you are so
  all the world will clear 
  you
  in the next place
  i conceived this exercise of wit would not be 
  least approved by you
  inasmuch as you are wont to be delighted with such 
  kind of mirth
  that is to say
  neither unlearned
  if i am not mistaken
  
  nor altogether insipid
  and in the whole course of your life have played 
  the part of a democritus
  and though such is the excellence of your 
  judgment that it was ever contrary to that of the people s
  yet such is 
  your incredible affability and sweetness of temper that you both can and 
  delight to carry yourself to all men a man of all hours
  wherefore you 
  will not only with good will accept this small declamation
  but take upon 
  you the defense of it
  for as much as being dedicated to you
  it is now 
  no longer mine but yours
  but perhaps there will not be wanting some 
  wranglers that may cavil and charge me
  partly that these toys are 
  lighter than may become a divine
  and partly more biting than may beseem 
  the modesty of a christian
  and consequently exclaim that i resemble the 
  ancient comedy
  or another lucian
  and snarl at everything
  but i would 
  have them whom the lightness or foolery of the argument may offend to 
  consider that mine is not the first of this kind
  but the same thing that 
  has been often practiced even by great authors
  when homer
  so many ages 
  since
  did the like with the battle of frogs and mice
  virgil
  with the 
  gnat and puddings
  ovid
  with the nut
  when polycrates and his corrector 
  isocrates extolled tyranny
  glauco
  injustice
  favorinus
  deformity and 
  the quartan ague
  synescius
  baldness
  lucian
  the fly and flattery
  when 
  seneca made such sport with claudius  canonizations
  plutarch
  with his 
  dialogue between ulysses and gryllus
  lucian and apuleius
  with the ass
  
  and some other
  i know not who
  with the hog that made his last will and 
  testament
  of which also even st
  jerome makes mention
  and therefore if 
  they please
  let them suppose i played at tables for my diversion
  or if 
  they had rather have it so
  that i rode on a hobbyhorse
  for what 
  injustice is it that when we allow every course of life its recreation
  
  that study only should have none
  especially when such toys are not 
  without their serious matter
  and foolery is so handled that the reader 
  that is not altogether thick skulled may reap more benefit from it than 
  from some men s crabbish and specious arguments
  as when one
  with long 
  study and great pains
  patches many pieces together on the praise of 
  rhetoric or philosophy
  another makes a panegyric to a prince
  another 
  encourages him to a war against the turks
  another tells you what will 
  become of the world after himself is dead
  and another finds out some new 
  device for the better ordering of goat s wool
  for as nothing is more 
  trifling than to treat of serious matters triflingly
  so nothing carries 
  a better grace than so to discourse of trifles as a man may seem to have 
  intended them least
  for my own part
  let other men judge of what i have 
  written
  though yet
  unless an overweening opinion of myself may have 
  made me blind in my own cause
  i have praised folly
  but not altogether 
  foolishly
  and now to say somewhat to that other cavil
  of biting
  this 
  liberty was ever permitted to all men s wits
  to make their smart
  witty 
  reflections on the common errors of mankind
  and that too without 
  offense
  as long as this liberty does not run into licentiousness
  which 
  makes me the more admire the tender ears of the men of this age
  that can 
  away with solemn titles
  no
  you ll meet with some so preposterously 
  religious that they will sooner endure the broadest scoffs even against 
  christ himself than hear the pope or a prince be touched in the least
  
  especially if it be anything that concerns their profit
  whereas he that 
  so taxes the lives of men
  without naming anyone in particular
  whither
  
  i pray
  may he be said to bite
  or rather to teach and admonish
  or 
  otherwise
  i beseech you
  under how many notions do i tax myself
  
  besides
  he that spares no sort of men cannot be said to be angry with 
  anyone in particular
  but the vices of all
  and therefore
  if there shall 
  happen to be anyone that shall say he is hit
  he will but discover either 
  his guilt or fear
  saint jerome sported in this kind with more freedom 
  and greater sharpness
  not sparing sometimes men s very name
  but i
  
  besides that i have wholly avoided it
  i have so moderated my style that 
  the understanding reader will easily perceive my endeavors herein were 
  rather to make mirth than bite
  nor have i
  after the example of juvenal
  
  raked up that forgotten sink of filth and ribaldry
  but laid before you 
  things rather ridiculous than dishonest
  and now
  if there be anyone that 
  is yet dissatisfied
  let him at least remember that it is no dishonor to 
  be discommended by folly
  and having brought her in speaking
  it was but 
  fit that i kept up the character of the person
  but why do i run over 
  these things to you
  a person so excellent an advocate that no man better 
  defends his client
  though the cause many times be none of the best
  
  farewell
  my best disputant more
  and stoutly defend your  moriae 
  
   
  from the country
  
  the 5th of the ides of june
  
   
   
   
   
                            the praise of folly 
   
   
                       an oration
  of feigned matter
  
                     spoken by folly in her own person 
   
   
  at what rate soever the world talks of me  for i am not ignorant what an 
  ill report folly has got
  even among the most foolish 
  yet that i am 
  that she
  that only she
  whose deity recreates both gods and men
  even 
  this is a sufficient argument
  that i no sooner stepped up to speak to 
  this full assembly than all your faces put on a kind of new and unwonted 
  pleasantness
  so suddenly have you cleared your brows
  and with so frolic 
  and hearty a laughter given me your applause
  that in truth as many of 
  you as i behold on every side of me seem to me no less than homer s gods 
  drunk with nectar and nepenthe
  whereas before
  you sat as lumpish and 
  pensive as if you had come from consulting an oracle
  and as it usually 
  happens when the sun begins to show his beams
  or when after a sharp 
  winter the spring breathes afresh on the earth
  all things immediately 
  get a new face
  new color
  and recover as it were a certain kind of youth 
  again
  in like manner
  by but beholding me you have in an instant gotten 
  another kind of countenance
  and so what the otherwise great rhetoricians 
  with their tedious and long studied orations can hardly effect
  to wit
  
  to remove the trouble of the mind
  i have done it at once with my 
  single look
  
   
  but if you ask me why i appear before you in this strange dress
  be 
  pleased to lend me your ears
  and i ll tell you
  not those ears
  i mean
  
  you carry to church
  but abroad with you
  such as you are wont to prick 
  up to jugglers
  fools
  and buffoons
  and such as our friend midas once 
  gave to pan
  for i am disposed awhile to play the sophist with you
  not 
  of their sort who nowadays boozle young men s heads with certain empty 
  notions and curious trifles
  yet teach them nothing but a more than 
  womanish obstinacy of scolding
  but i ll imitate those ancients who
  that 
  they might the better avoid that infamous appellation of  sophi  or 
   wise 
  chose rather to be called sophists
  their business was to 
  celebrate the praises of the gods and valiant men
  and the like encomium 
  shall you hear from me
  but neither of hercules nor solon
  but my own 
  dear self
  that is to say
  folly
  nor do i esteem a rush that call it a 
  foolish and insolent thing to praise one s self
  be it as foolish as they 
  would make it
  so they confess it proper
  and what can be more than that 
  folly be her own trumpet
  for who can set me out better than myself
  
  unless perhaps i could be better known to another than to myself
  though 
  yet i think it somewhat more modest than the general practice of our 
  nobles and wise men who
  throwing away all shame
  hire some flattering 
  orator or lying poet from whose mouth they may hear their praises
  that 
  is to say
  mere lies
  and yet
  composing themselves with a seeming 
  modesty
  spread out their peacock s plumes and erect their crests
  while 
  this impudent flatterer equals a man of nothing to the gods and proposes 
  him as an absolute pattern of all virtue that s wholly a stranger to it
  
  sets out a pitiful jay in other s feathers
  washes the blackamoor white
  
  and lastly swells a gnat to an elephant
  in short
  i will follow that old 
  proverb that says
  
 he may lawfully praise himself that lives far from 
  neighbors
 
  though
  by the way
  i cannot but wonder at the ingratitude
  
  shall i say
  or negligence of men who
  notwithstanding they honor me in 
  the first place and are willing enough to confess my bounty
  yet not one 
  of them for these so many ages has there been who in some thankful 
  oration has set out the praises of folly
  when yet there has not wanted 
  them whose elaborate endeavors have extolled tyrants
  agues
  flies
  
  baldness
  and such other pests of nature
  to their own loss of both time 
  and sleep
  and now you shall hear from me a plain extemporary speech
  but 
  so much the truer
  nor would i have you think it like the rest of 
  orators
  made for the ostentation of wit
  for these
  as you know
  when 
  they have been beating their heads some thirty years about an oration and 
  at last perhaps produce somewhat that was never their own
  shall yet 
  swear they composed it in three days
  and that too for diversion
  whereas 
  i ever liked it best to speak whatever came first out
  
   
  but let none of you expect from me that after the manner of rhetoricians 
  i should go about to define what i am
  much less use any division
  for i 
  hold it equally unlucky to circumscribe her whose deity is universal
  or 
  make the least division in that worship about which everything is so 
  generally agreed
  or to what purpose
  think you
  should i describe myself 
  when i am here present before you
  and you behold me speaking
  for i am
  
  as you see
  that true and only giver of wealth whom the greeks call 
   moria 
  the latins  stultitia 
  and our plain english  folly 
  or what 
  need was there to have said so much
  as if my very looks were not 
  sufficient to inform you who i am
  or as if any man
  mistaking me for 
  wisdom
  could not at first sight convince himself by my face the true 
  index of my mind
  i am no counterfeit
  nor do i carry one thing in my 
  looks and another in my breast
  no
  i am in every respect so like myself 
  that neither can they dissemble me who arrogate to themselves the 
  appearance and title of wise men and walk like asses in scarlet hoods
  
  though after all their hypocrisy midas  ears will discover their master
  
  a most ungrateful generation of men that
  when they are wholly given up 
  to my party
  are yet publicly ashamed of the name
  as taking it for a 
  reproach
  for which cause
  since in truth they are  morotatoi 
  fools
  
  and yet would appear to the world to be wise men and thales
  we ll even 
  call them  morosophous 
  wise fools
  
   
  nor will it be amiss also to imitate the rhetoricians of our times
  who 
  think themselves in a manner gods if like horse leeches they can but 
  appear to be double tongued
  and believe they have done a mighty act if 
  in their latin orations they can but shuffle in some ends of greek like 
  mosaic work
  though altogether by head and shoulders and less to the 
  purpose
  and if they want hard words
  they run over some worm eaten 
  manuscript and pick out half a dozen of the most old and obsolete to 
  confound their reader
  believing
  no doubt
  that they that understand 
  their meaning will like it the better
  and they that do not will admire 
  it the more by how much the less they understand it
  nor is this way of 
  ours of admiring what seems most foreign without its particular grace
  
  for if there happen to be any more ambitious than others
  they may give 
  their applause with a smile
  and
  like the ass
  shake their ears
  that 
  they may be thought to understand more than the rest of their neighbors
  
   
  but to come to the purpose
  i have given you my name
  but what epithet 
  shall i add
  what but that of the most foolish
  for by what more proper 
  name can so great a goddess as folly be known to her disciples
  and 
  because it is not alike known to all from what stock i am sprung
  with 
  the muses  good leave i ll do my endeavor to satisfy you
  but yet neither 
  the first chaos
  orcus
  saturn
  or japhet
  nor any of those threadbare
  
  musty gods were my father
  but plutus
  riches
  that only he
  that is
  in 
  spite of hesiod
  homer
  nay and jupiter himself
   divum pater atque 
  hominum rex 
  the father of gods and men
  at whose single beck
  as 
  heretofore
  so at present
  all things sacred and profane are turned 
  topsy turvy
  according to whose pleasure war
  peace
  empire
  counsels
  
  judgments
  assemblies
  wedlocks
  bargains
  leagues
  laws
  arts
  all 
  things light or serious  i want breath  in short
  all the public and 
  private business of mankind is governed
  without whose help all that herd 
  of gods of the poets  making
  and those few of the better sort of the 
  rest
  either would not be at all
  or if they were
  they would be but such 
  as live at home and keep a poor house to themselves
  and to whomsoever 
  he s an enemy
   tis not pallas herself that can befriend him
  as on the 
  contrary he whom he favors may lead jupiter and his thunder in a string
  
  this is my father and in him i glory
  nor did he produce me from his 
  brain
  as jupiter that sour and ill looked pallas
  but of that lovely 
  nymph called youth
  the most beautiful and galliard of all the rest
  nor 
  was i
  like that limping blacksmith
  begot in the sad and irksome bonds 
  of matrimony
  yet
  mistake me not
   twas not that blind and decrepit 
  plutus in aristophanes that got me
  but such as he was in his full 
  strength and pride of youth
  and not that only
  but at such a time when 
  he had been well heated with nectar
  of which he had
  at one of the 
  banquets of the gods
  taken a dose extraordinary
  
   
  and as to the place of my birth
  forasmuch as nowadays that is looked 
  upon as a main point of nobility
  it was neither
  like apollo s
  in the 
  floating delos
  nor venus like on the rolling sea
  nor in any of blind 
  homer s as blind caves
  but in the fortunate islands
  where all things 
  grew without plowing or sowing
  where neither labor
  nor old age
  nor 
  disease was ever heard of
  and in whose fields neither daffodil
  mallows
  
  onions
  beans
  and such contemptible things would ever grow
  but
  on the 
  contrary
  rue
  angelica
  bugloss
  marjoram
  trefoils
  roses
  violets
  
  lilies
  and all the gardens of adonis invite both your sight and your 
  smelling
  and being thus born
  i did not begin the world
  as other 
  children are wont
  with crying
  but straight perched up and smiled on my 
  mother
  nor do i envy to the great jupiter the goat
  his nurse
  forasmuch 
  as i was suckled by two jolly nymphs
  to wit
  drunkenness
  the daughter 
  of bacchus
  and ignorance
  of pan
  and as for such my companions and 
  followers as you perceive about me
  if you have a mind to know who they 
  are
  you are not like to be the wiser for me
  unless it be in greek
  this 
  here
  which you observe with that proud cast of her eye
  is  philautia 
  
  self love
  she with the smiling countenance
  that is ever and anon 
  clapping her hands
  is  kolakia 
  flattery
  she that looks as if she were 
  half asleep is  lethe 
  oblivion
  she that sits leaning on both elbows 
  with her hands clutched together is  misoponia 
  laziness
  she with the 
  garland on her head
  and that smells so strong of perfumes
  is  hedone 
  
  pleasure
  she with those staring eyes
  moving here and there
  is  anoia 
  
  madness
  she with the smooth skin and full pampered body is  tryphe 
  
  wantonness
  and
  as to the two gods that you see with them
  the one is 
   komos 
  intemperance
  the other  negretos hypnos 
  dead sleep
  these
  i 
  say
  are my household servants
  and by their faithful counsels i have 
  subjected all things to my dominion and erected an empire over emperors 
  themselves
  thus have you had my lineage
  education
  and companions
  
   
  and now
  lest i may seem to have taken upon me the name of goddess 
  without cause
  you shall in the next place understand how far my deity 
  extends
  and what advantage by it i have brought both to gods and men
  
  for
  if it was not unwisely said by somebody
  that this only is to be a 
  god
  to help men
  and if they are deservedly enrolled among the gods that 
  first brought in corn and wine and such other things as are for the 
  common good of mankind
  why am not i of right the  alpha 
  or first
  of 
  all the gods
  who being but one
  yet bestow all things on all men
  for 
  first
  what is more sweet or more precious than life
  and yet from whom 
  can it more properly be said to come than from me
  for neither the 
  crab favoured pallas  spear nor the cloud gathering jupiter s shield 
  either beget or propagate mankind
  but even he himself
  the father of 
  gods and king of men at whose very beck the heavens shake
  must lay by 
  his forked thunder and those looks wherewith he conquered the giants 
  and with which at pleasure he frightens the rest of the gods
  and like 
  a common stage player put on a disguise as often as he goes about that
  
  which now and then he does
  that is to say the getting of children
  and 
  the stoics too
  that conceive themselves next to the gods
  yet show me 
  one of them
  nay the veriest bigot of the sect
  and if he do not put off 
  his beard
  the badge of wisdom
  though yet it be no more than what is 
  common with him and goats
  yet at least he must lay by his supercilious 
  gravity
  smooth his forehead
  shake off his rigid principles
  and for 
  some time commit an act of folly and dotage
  in fine
  that wise man 
  whoever he be
  if he intends to have children
  must have recourse to me
  
  but tell me
  i beseech you
  what man is that would submit his neck to 
  the noose of wedlock
  if
  as wise men should
  he did but first truly 
  weigh the inconvenience of the thing
  or what woman is there would ever 
  go to it did she seriously consider either the peril of child bearing or 
  the trouble of bringing them up
  so then
  if you owe your beings to 
  wedlock
  you owe that wedlock to this my follower
  madness
  and what 
  you owe to me i have already told you
  again
  she that has but once 
  tried what it is
  would she
  do you think
  make a second venture if it 
  were not for my other companion
  oblivion
  nay
  even venus herself
  
  notwithstanding whatever lucretius has said
  would not deny but that 
  all her virtue were lame and fruitless without the help of my deity
  
  for out of that little
  odd
  ridiculous may game came the supercilious 
  philosophers
  in whose room have succeeded a kind of people the world 
  calls monks
  cardinals
  priests
  and the most holy popes
  and lastly
  
  all that rabble of the poets  gods
  with which heaven is so thwacked 
  and thronged
  that though it be of so vast an extent
  they are hardly 
  able to crowd one by another
  
   
  but i think it is a small matter that you thus owe your beginning of life 
  to me
  unless i also show you that whatever benefit you receive in the 
  progress of it is of my gift likewise
  for what other is this
  can that 
  be called life where you take away pleasure
  oh
  do you like what i say
  
  i knew none of you could have so little wit
  or so much folly
  or wisdom 
  rather
  as to be of any other opinion
  for even the stoics themselves 
  that so severely cried down pleasure did but handsomely dissemble
  and 
  railed against it to the common people to no other end but that having 
  discouraged them from it
  they might the more plentifully enjoy it 
  themselves
  but tell me
  by jupiter
  what part of man s life is that that 
  is not sad
  crabbed
  unpleasant
  insipid
  troublesome
  unless it be 
  seasoned with pleasure
  that is to say
  folly
  for the proof of which the 
  never sufficiently praised sophocles in that his happy elegy of us
  
 to 
  know nothing is the only happiness
 
  might be authority enough
  but that 
  i intend to take every particular by itself
  
   
  and first
  who knows not but a man s infancy is the merriest part of life 
  to himself
  and most acceptable to others
  for what is that in them which 
  we kiss
  embrace
  cherish
  nay enemies succor
  but this witchcraft of 
  folly
  which wise nature did of purpose give them into the world with 
  them that they might the more pleasantly pass over the toil of education
  
  and as it were flatter the care and diligence of their nurses
  and then 
  for youth
  which is in such reputation everywhere
  how do all men favor 
  it
  study to advance it
  and lend it their helping hand
  and whence
  i 
  pray
  all this grace
  whence but from me
  by whose kindness
  as it 
  understands as little as may be
  it is also for that reason the higher 
  privileged from exceptions
  and i am mistaken if
  when it is grown up and 
  by experience and discipline brought to savor something like man
  if in 
  the same instant that beauty does not fade
  its liveliness decay
  its 
  pleasantness grow flat
  and its briskness fail
  and by how much the 
  further it runs from me
  by so much the less it lives
  till it comes to 
  the burden of old age
  not only hateful to others
  but to itself also
  
  which also were altogether insupportable did not i pity its condition
  in 
  being present with it
  and
  as the poets  gods were wont to assist such 
  as were dying with some pleasant metamorphosis
  help their decrepitness 
  as much as in me lies by bringing them back to a second childhood
  from 
  whence they are not improperly called twice children
  which
  if you ask 
  me how i do it
  i shall not be shy in the point
  i bring them to our 
  river lethe  for its springhead rises in the fortunate islands
  and that 
  other of hell is but a brook in comparison 
  from which
  as soon as they 
  have drunk down a long forgetfulness
  they wash away by degrees the 
  perplexity of their minds
  and so wax young again
  
   
  but perhaps you ll say they are foolish and doting
  admit it
   tis the 
  very essence of childhood
  as if to be such were not to be a fool
  or 
  that that condition had anything pleasant in it
  but that it understood 
  nothing
  for who would not look upon that child as a prodigy that should 
  have as much wisdom as a man
   according to that common proverb
  
 i do 
  not like a child that is a man too soon
 
  or who would endure a converse 
  or friendship with that old man who to so large an experience of things 
  had joined an equal strength of mind and sharpness of judgment
  and 
  therefore for this reason it is that old age dotes
  and that it does so
  
  it is beholding to me
  yet
  notwithstanding
  is this dotard exempt from 
  all those cares that distract a wise man
  he is not the less pot 
  companion
  nor is he sensible of that burden of life which the more manly 
  age finds enough to do to stand upright under it
  and sometimes too
  like 
  plautus  old man
  he returns to his three letters
  a
 m
 o
 
  the most 
  unhappy of all things living
  if he rightly understood what he did in it
  
  and yet
  so much do i befriend him that i make him well received of his 
  friends and no unpleasant companion
  for as much as
  according to homer
  
  nestor s discourse was pleasanter than honey
  whereas achilles  was both 
  bitter and malicious
  and that of old men
  as he has it in another place
  
  florid
  in which respect also they have this advantage of children
  in 
  that they want the only pleasure of the others  life
  we ll suppose it 
  prattling
  add to this that old men are more eagerly delighted with 
  children
  and they
  again
  with old men
  
 like to like
 
  quoted the devil 
  to the collier
  for what difference between them
  but that the one has 
  more wrinkles and years upon his head than the other
  otherwise
  the 
  brightness of their hair
  toothless mouth
  weakness of body
  love of 
  mild
  broken speech
  chatting
  toying
  forgetfulness
  inadvertency
  and 
  briefly
  all other their actions agree in everything
  and by how much the 
  nearer they approach to this old age
  by so much they grow backward into 
  the likeness of children
  until like them they pass from life to death
  
  without any weariness of the one
  or sense of the other
  
   
  and now
  let him that will compare the benefits they receive by me
  the 
  metamorphoses of the gods
  of whom i shall not mention what they have 
  done in their pettish humors but where they have been most favorable
  
  turning one into a tree
  another into a bird
  a third into a grasshopper
  
  serpent
  or the like
  as if there were any difference between perishing 
  and being another thing
  but i restore the same man to the best and 
  happiest part of his life
  and if men would but refrain from all commerce 
  with wisdom and give up themselves to be governed by me
  they should 
  never know what it were to be old
  but solace themselves with a perpetual 
  youth
  do but observe our grim philosophers that are perpetually beating 
  their brains on knotty subjects
  and for the most part you ll find them 
  grown old before they are scarcely young
  and whence is it
  but that 
  their continual and restless thoughts insensibly prey upon their spirits 
  and dry up their radical moisture
  whereas
  on the contrary
  my fat fools 
  are as plump and round as a westphalian hog
  and never sensible of old 
  age
  unless perhaps
  as sometimes it rarely happens
  they come to be 
  infected with wisdom
  so hard a thing it is for a man to be happy in all 
  things
  and to this purpose is that no small testimony of the proverb
  
  that says
  
 folly is the only thing that keeps youth at a stay and old 
  age afar off
 
  as it is verified in the brabanders
  of whom there goes 
  this common saying
  
 that age
  which is wont to render other men wiser
  
  makes them the greater fools
 
  and yet there is scarce any nation of a 
  more jocund converse
  or that is less sensible of the misery of old age
  
  than they are
  and to these
  as in situation
  so for manner of living
  
  come nearest my friends the hollanders
  and why should i not call them 
  mine
  since they are so diligent observers of me that they are commonly 
  called by my name
   of which they are so far from being ashamed
  they 
  rather pride themselves in it
  let the foolish world then be packing and 
  seek out medeas
  circes
  venuses
  auroras
  and i know not what other 
  fountains of restoring youth
  i am sure i am the only person that both 
  can
  and have
  made it good
   tis i alone that have that wonderful juice 
  with which memnon s daughter prolonged the youth of her grandfather 
  tithon
  i am that venus by whose favor phaon became so young again that 
  sappho fell in love with him
  mine are those herbs
  if yet there be any 
  such
  mine those charms
  and mine that fountain that not only restores 
  departed youth but
  which is more desirable
  preserves it perpetual
  and 
  if you all subscribe to this opinion
  that nothing is better than youth 
  or more execrable than age
  i conceive you cannot but see how much you 
  are indebted to me
  that have retained so great a good and shut out so 
  great an evil
  
   
  but why do i altogether spend my breath in speaking of mortals
  view 
  heaven round
  and let him that will reproach me with my name if he find 
  any one of the gods that were not stinking and contemptible were he not 
  made acceptable by my deity
  why is it that bacchus is always a 
  stripling
  and bushy haired
  but because he is mad
  and drunk
  and spends 
  his life in drinking
  dancing
  revels
  and may games
  not having so much 
  as the least society with pallas
  and lastly
  he is so far from desiring 
  to be accounted wise that he delights to be worshiped with sports and 
  gambols
  nor is he displeased with the proverb that gave him the surname 
  of fool
  
 a greater fool than bacchus
 
  which name of his was changed to 
  morychus
  for that sitting before the gates of his temple
  the wanton 
  country people were wont to bedaub him with new wine and figs
  and of 
  scoffs
  what not
  have not the ancient comedies thrown on him
  o foolish 
  god
  say they
  and worthy to be born as you were of your father s thigh
  
  and yet
  who had not rather be your fool and sot
  always merry
  ever 
  young
  and making sport for other people
  than either homer s jupiter 
  with his crooked counsels
  terrible to everyone
  or old pan with his 
  hubbubs
  or smutty vulcan half covered with cinders
  or even pallas 
  herself
  so dreadful with her gorgon s head and spear and a countenance 
  like bullbeef
  why is cupid always portrayed like a boy
  but because he 
  is a very wag and can neither do nor so much as think of anything sober
  
  why venus ever in her prime
  but because of her affinity with me
  witness 
  that color of her hair
  so resembling my father
  from whence she is 
  called the golden venus
  and lastly
  ever laughing
  if you give any 
  credit to the poets
  or their followers the statuaries
  what deity did 
  the romans ever more religiously adore than that of flora
  the foundress 
  of all pleasure
  nay
  if you should but diligently search the lives of 
  the most sour and morose of the gods out of homer and the rest of the 
  poets
  you would find them all but so many pieces of folly
  and to what 
  purpose should i run over any of the other gods  tricks when you know 
  enough of jupiter s loose loves
  when that chaste diana shall so far 
  forget her sex as to be ever hunting and ready to perish for endymion
  
  but i had rather they should hear these things from momus
  from whom 
  heretofore they were wont to have their shares
  till in one of their 
  angry humors they tumbled him
  together with ate
  goddess of mischief
  
  down headlong to the earth
  because his wisdom
  forsooth
  unseasonably 
  disturbed their happiness
  nor since that dares any mortal give him 
  harbor
  though i must confess there wanted little but that he had been 
  received into the courts of princes
  had not my companion flattery 
  reigned in chief there
  with whom and the other there is no more 
  correspondence than between lambs and wolves
  from whence it is that the 
  gods play the fool with the greater liberty and more content to 
  themselves 
 doing all things carelessly
 
  as says father homer
  that is 
  to say
  without anyone to correct them
  for what ridiculous stuff is 
  there which that stump of the fig tree priapus does not afford them
  what 
  tricks and legerdemains with which mercury does not cloak his thefts
  
  what buffoonery that vulcan is not guilty of
  while one with his 
  polt foot
  another with his smutched muzzle
  another with his 
  impertinencies
  he makes sport for the rest of the gods
  as also that old 
  silenus with his country dances
  polyphemus footing time to his cyclops 
  hammers
  the nymphs with their jigs
  and satyrs with their antics
  while 
  pan makes them all twitter with some coarse ballad
  which yet they had 
  rather hear than the muses themselves
  and chiefly when they are well 
  whittled with nectar
  besides
  what should i mention what these gods do 
  when they are half drunk
  now by my troth
  so foolish that i myself can 
  hardly refrain laughter
  but in these matters  twere better we remembered 
  harpocrates
  lest some eavesdropping god or other take us whispering that 
  which momus only has the privilege of speaking at length
  
   
  and therefore
  according to homer s example
  i think it high time to 
  leave the gods to themselves
  and look down a little on the earth
  
  wherein likewise you ll find nothing frolic or fortunate that it owes not 
  to me
  so provident has that great parent of mankind
  nature
  been that 
  there should not be anything without its mixture and
  as it were
  
  seasoning of folly
  for since according to the definition of the stoics
  
  wisdom is nothing else than to be governed by reason
  and on the contrary 
  folly
  to be given up to the will of our passions
  that the life of man 
  might not be altogether disconsolate and hard to away with
  of how much 
  more passion than reason has jupiter composed us
  putting in
  as one 
  would say
  
 scarce half an ounce to a pound
 
  besides
  he has confined 
  reason to a narrow corner of the brain and left all the rest of the body 
  to our passions
  has also set up
  against this one
  two as it were
  
  masterless tyrants  anger
  that possesses the region of the heart
  and 
  consequently the very fountain of life
  the heart itself
  and lust
  that 
  stretches its empire everywhere
  against which double force how powerful 
  reason is let common experience declare
  inasmuch as she
  which yet is 
  all she can do
  may call out to us till she be hoarse again and tell us 
  the rules of honesty and virtue
  while they give up the reins to their 
  governor and make a hideous clamor
  till at last being wearied
  he suffer 
  himself to be carried whither they please to hurry him
  
   
  but forasmuch as such as are born to the business of the world have some 
  little sprinklings of reason more than the rest
  yet that they may the 
  better manage it
  even in this as well as in other things
  they call me 
  to counsel
  and i give them such as is worthy of myself
  to wit
  that 
  they take to them a wife  a silly thing
  god wot
  and foolish
  yet wanton 
  and pleasant
  by which means the roughness of the masculine temper is 
  seasoned and sweetened by her folly
  for in that plato seems to doubt 
  under what genus he should put woman
  to wit
  that of rational creatures 
  or brutes
  he intended no other in it than to show the apparent folly of 
  the sex
  for if perhaps any of them goes about to be thought wiser than 
  the rest
  what else does she do but play the fool twice
  as if a man 
  should 
 teach a cow to dance
 
  
 a thing quite against the hair
 
  for as 
  it doubles the crime if anyone should put a disguise upon nature
  or 
  endeavor to bring her to that she will in no wise bear
  according to that 
  proverb of the greeks
  
 an ape is an ape
  though clad in scarlet
 
  so a 
  woman is a woman still
  that is to say foolish
  let her put on whatever 
  vizard she please
  
   
  but
  by the way
  i hope that sex is not so foolish as to take offense at 
  this
  that i myself
  being a woman
  and folly too
  have attributed folly 
  to them
  for if they weigh it right
  they needs must acknowledge that 
  they owe it to folly that they are more fortunate than men
  as first 
  their beauty
  which
  and that not without cause
  they prefer before 
  everything
  since by its means they exercise a tyranny even upon tyrants 
  themselves
  otherwise
  whence proceeds that sour look
  rough skin
  bushy 
  beard
  and such other things as speak plain old age in a man
  but from 
  that disease of wisdom
  whereas women s cheeks are ever plump and smooth
  
  their voice small
  their skin soft
  as if they imitated a certain kind of 
  perpetual youth
  again
  what greater thing do they wish in their whole 
  lives than that they may please the man
  for to what other purpose are 
  all those dresses
  washes
  baths
  slops
  perfumes
  and those several 
  little tricks of setting their faces
  painting their eyebrows
  and 
  smoothing their skins
  and now tell me
  what higher letters of 
  recommendation have they to men than this folly
  for what is it they do 
  not permit them to do
  and to what other purpose than that of pleasure
  
  wherein yet their folly is not the least thing that pleases
  which so 
  true it is
  i think no one will deny
  that does but consider with 
  himself
  what foolish discourse and odd gambols pass between a man and 
  his woman
  as often as he had a mind to be gamesome
  and so i have shown 
  you whence the first and chiefest delight of man s life springs
  
   
   
  but there are some
  you ll say
  and those too none of the youngest
  that 
  have a greater kindness for the pot than the petticoat and place their 
  chiefest pleasure in good fellowship
  if there can be any great 
  entertainment without a woman at it
  let others look to it
  this i am 
  sure
  there was never any pleasant which folly gave not the relish to
  
  insomuch that if they find no occasion of laughter
  they send for 
 one 
  that may make it
 
  or hire some buffoon flatterer
  whose ridiculous 
  discourse may put by the gravity of the company
  for to what purpose were 
  it to clog our stomachs with dainties
  junkets
  and the like stuff
  
  unless our eyes and ears
  nay whole mind
  were likewise entertained with 
  jests
  merriments
  and laughter
  but of these kind of second courses i am 
  the only cook
  though yet those ordinary practices of our feasts
  as 
  choosing a king
  throwing dice
  drinking healths
  trolling it round
  
  dancing the cushion
  and the like
  were not invented by the seven wise 
  men but myself
  and that too for the common pleasure of mankind
  the 
  nature of all which things is such that the more of folly they have
  the 
  more they conduce to human life
  which
  if it were unpleasant
  did not 
  deserve the name of life
  and other than such it could not well be
  
  did not these kind of diversions wipe away tediousness
  next cousin to 
  the other
  
   
  but perhaps there are some that neglect this way of pleasure and rest 
  satisfied in the enjoyment of their friends
  calling friendship the most 
  desirable of all things
  more necessary than either air
  fire
  or water
  
  so delectable that he that shall take it out of the world had as good put 
  out the sun
  and
  lastly
  so commendable
  if yet that make anything to 
  the matter
  that neither the philosophers themselves doubted to reckon it 
  among their chiefest good
  but what if i show you that i am both the 
  beginning and end of this so great good also
  nor shall i go about to 
  prove it by fallacies
  sorites
  dilemmas
  or other the like subtleties of 
  logicians
  but after my blunt way point out the thing as clearly as it 
  were with my finger
  
   
  and now tell me if to wink
  slip over
  be blind at
  or deceived in the 
  vices of our friends
  nay
  to admire and esteem them for virtues
  be not 
  at least the next degree to folly
  what is it when one kisses his 
  mistress  freckle neck
  another the wart on her nose
  when a father shall 
  swear his squint eyed child is more lovely than venus
  what is this
  i 
  say
  but mere folly
  and so
  perhaps you ll cry it is
  and yet  tis this 
  only that joins friends together and continues them so joined
  i speak of 
  ordinary men
  of whom none are born without their imperfections
  and 
  happy is he that is pressed with the least
  for among wise princes there 
  is either no friendship at all
  or if there be
   tis unpleasant and 
  reserved
  and that too but among a very few  twere a crime to say none
  
  for that the greatest part of mankind are fools
  nay there is not anyone 
  that dotes not in many things
  and friendship
  you know
  is seldom made 
  but among equals
  and yet if it should so happen that there were a mutual 
  good will between them
  it is in no wise firm nor very long lived
  that 
  is to say
  among such as are morose and more circumspect than needs
  as 
  being eagle sighted into his friends  faults
  but so blear eyed to their 
  own that they take not the least notice of the wallet that hangs behind 
  their own shoulders
  since then the nature of man is such that there is 
  scarce anyone to be found that is not subject to many errors
  add to this 
  the great diversity of minds and studies
  so many slips
  oversights
  and 
  chances of human life
  and how is it possible there should be any true 
  friendship between those argus
  so much as one hour
  were it not for that 
  which the greeks excellently call  euetheian 
  and you may render by 
  folly or good nature
  choose you whether
  but what
  is not the author and 
  parent of all our love
  cupid
  as blind as a beetle
  and as with him all 
  colors agree
  so from him is it that everyone likes his own sweeter kin 
  best
  though never so ugly
  and 
 that an old man dotes on his old wife
  
  and a boy on his girl
 
  these things are not only done everywhere but 
  laughed at too
  yet as ridiculous as they are
  they make society 
  pleasant
  and
  as it were
  glue it together
  
   
  and what has been said of friendship may more reasonably be presumed of 
  matrimony
  which in truth is no other than an inseparable conjunction of 
  life
  good god
  what divorces
  or what not worse than that
  would daily 
  happen were not the converse between a man and his wife supported and 
  cherished by flattery
  apishness
  gentleness
  ignorance
  dissembling
  
  certain retainers of mine also
  whoop holiday
  how few marriages should 
  we have
  if the husband should but thoroughly examine how many tricks his 
  pretty little mop of modesty has played before she was married
  and how 
  fewer of them would hold together
  did not most of the wife s actions 
  escape the husband s knowledge through his neglect or sottishness
  and 
  for this also you are beholden to me
  by whose means it is that the 
  husband is pleasant to his wife
  the wife to her husband
  and the house 
  kept in quiet
  a man is laughed at
  when seeing his wife weeping he licks 
  up her tears
  but how much happier is it to be thus deceived than by 
  being troubled with jealousy not only to torment himself but set all 
  things in a hubbub
  
   
  in fine
  i am so necessary to the making of all society and manner of 
  life both delightful and lasting
  that neither would the people long 
  endure their governors
  nor the servant his master
  nor the master his 
  footman
  nor the scholar his tutor
  nor one friend another
  nor the wife 
  her husband
  nor the usurer the borrower
  nor a soldier his commander
  
  nor one companion another
  unless all of them had their interchangeable 
  failings
  one while flattering
  other while prudently conniving
  and 
  generally sweetening one another with some small relish of folly
  
   
  and now you d think i had said all
  but you shall hear yet greater 
  things
  will he
  i pray
  love anyone that hates himself
  or ever agree 
  with another who is not at peace with himself
  or beget pleasure in 
  another that is troublesome to himself
  i think no one will say it that 
  is not more foolish than folly
  and yet
  if you should exclude me
  
  there s no man but would be so far from enduring another that he would 
  stink in his own nostrils
  be nauseated with his own actions
  and himself 
  become odious to himself
  forasmuch as nature
  in too many things rather 
  a stepdame than a parent to us
  has imprinted that evil in men
  
  especially such as have least judgment
  that everyone repents him of his 
  own condition and admires that of others
  whence it comes to pass that 
  all her gifts
  elegancy
  and graces corrupt and perish
  for what benefit 
  is beauty
  the greatest blessing of heaven
  if it be mixed with 
  affectation
  what youth
  if corrupted with the severity of old age
  
  lastly
  what is that in the whole business of a man s life he can do with 
  any grace to himself or others  for it is not so much a thing of art
  as 
  the very life of every action
  that it be done with a good mien  unless 
  this my friend and companion
  self love
  be present with it
  nor does she 
  without cause supply me the place of a sister
  since her whole endeavors 
  are to act my part everywhere
  for what is more foolish than for a man to 
  study nothing else than how to please himself
  to make himself the object 
  of his own admiration
  and yet
  what is there that is either delightful 
  or taking
  nay rather what not the contrary
  that a man does against the 
  hair
  take away this salt of life
  and the orator may even sit still with 
  his action
  the musician with all his division will be able to please no 
  man
  the player be hissed off the stage
  the poet and all his muses 
  ridiculous
  the painter with his art contemptible
  and the physician with 
  all his slip slops go a begging
  lastly
  you will be taken for an ugly 
  fellow instead of youthful
  and a beast instead of a wise man
  a child 
  instead of eloquent
  and instead of a well bred man
  a clown
  so 
  necessary a thing it is that everyone flatter himself and commend himself 
  to himself before he can be commended by others
  
   
  lastly
  since it is the chief point of happiness 
 that a man is willing 
  to be what he is
 
  you have further abridged in this my self love
  that 
  no man is ashamed of his own face
  no man of his own wit
  no man of his 
  own parentage
  no man of his own house
  no man of his manner of living
  
  nor any man of his own country
  so that a highlander has no desire to 
  change with an italian
  a thracian with an athenian
  nor a scythian for 
  the fortunate islands
  o the singular care of nature
  that in so great a 
  variety of things has made all equal
  where she has been sometimes 
  sparing of her gifts she has recompensed it with the more of self love
  
  though here
  i must confess
  i speak foolishly
  it being the greatest of 
  all other her gifts
  to say nothing that no great action was ever 
  attempted without my motion
  or art brought to perfection without my 
  help
  
   
  is not war the very root and matter of all famed enterprises
  and yet 
  what more foolish than to undertake it for i know what trifles
  
  especially when both parties are sure to lose more than they get by the 
  bargain
  for of those that are slain
  not a word of them
  and for the 
  rest
  when both sides are close engaged 
 and the trumpets make an ugly 
  noise
 
  what use of those wise men
  i pray
  that are so exhausted with 
  study that their thin
  cold blood has scarce any spirits left
  no
  it 
  must be those blunt
  fat fellows
  that by how much the more they exceed 
  in courage
  fall short in understanding
  unless perhaps one had rather 
  choose demosthenes for a soldier
  who
  following the example of 
  archilochius
  threw away his arms and betook him to his heels e er he had 
  scarce seen his enemy
  as ill a soldier
  as happy an orator
  
   
  but counsel
  you ll say
  is not of least concern in matters of war
  in a 
  general i grant it
  but this thing of warring is not part of philosophy
  
  but managed by parasites
  panders
  thieves
  cut throats
  plowmen
  sots
  
  spendthrifts
  and such other dregs of mankind
  not philosophers
  who how 
  unapt they are even for common converse
  let socrates
  whom the oracle of 
  apollo
  though not so wisely
  judged 
 the wisest of all men living
 
  be 
  witness
  who stepping up to speak somewhat
  i know not what
  in public 
  was forced to come down again well laughed at for his pains
  though yet 
  in this he was not altogether a fool
  that he refused the appellation of 
  wise
  and returning it back to the oracle
  delivered his opinion that a 
  wise man should abstain from meddling with public business
  unless 
  perhaps he should have rather admonished us to beware of wisdom if we 
  intended to be reckoned among the number of men
  there being nothing but 
  his wisdom that first accused and afterwards sentenced him to the 
  drinking of his poisoned cup
  for while
  as you find him in aristophanes
  
  philosophizing about clouds and ideas
  measuring how far a flea could 
  leap
  and admiring that so small a creature as a fly should make so great 
  a buzz
  he meddled not with anything that concerned common life
  but his 
  master being in danger of his head
  his scholar plato is at hand
  to wit 
  that famous patron
  that being disturbed with the noise of the people
  
  could not go through half his first sentence
  what should i speak of 
  theophrastus
  who being about to make an oration
  became as dumb as if he 
  had met a wolf in his way
  which yet would have put courage in a man of 
  war
  or isocrates
  that was so cowhearted that he dared never attempt it
  
  or tully
  that great founder of the roman eloquence
  that could never 
  begin to speak without an odd kind of trembling
  like a boy that had got 
  the hiccough
  which fabius interprets as an argument of a wise orator and 
  one that was sensible of what he was doing
  and while he says it
  does he 
  not plainly confess that wisdom is a great obstacle to the true 
  management of business
  what would become of them
  think you
  were they 
  to fight it out at blows that are so dead through fear when the contest 
  is only with empty words
  
   
  and next to these is cried up
  forsooth
  that goodly sentence of plato s
  
  
 happy is that commonwealth where a philosopher is prince
  or whose 
  prince is addicted to philosophy
 
  when yet if you consult historians
  
  you ll find no princes more pestilent to the commonwealth than where the 
  empire has fallen to some smatterer in philosophy or one given to 
  letters
  to the truth of which i think the catoes give sufficient credit
  
  of whom the one was ever disturbing the peace of the commonwealth with 
  his hair brained accusations
  the other
  while he too wisely vindicated 
  its liberty
  quite overthrew it
  add to this the bruti
  casii
  nay cicero 
  himself
  that was no less pernicious to the commonwealth of rome than was 
  demosthenes to that of athens
  besides m
  antoninus  that i may give you 
  one instance that there was once one good emperor
  for with much ado i 
  can make it out  was become burdensome and hated of his subjects upon no 
  other score but that he was so great a philosopher
  but admitting him 
  good
  he did the commonwealth more hurt in leaving behind him such a son 
  as he did than ever he did it good by his own government
  for these kind 
  of men that are so given up to the study of wisdom are generally most 
  unfortunate
  but chiefly in their children
  nature
  it seems
  so 
  providently ordering it
  lest this mischief of wisdom should spread 
  further among mankind
  for which reason it is manifest why cicero s son 
  was so degenerate
  and that wise socrates  children
  as one has well 
  observed
  were more like their mother than their father
  that is to 
  say
  fools
  
   
  however this were to be born with
  if only as to public employments they 
  were 
 like a sow upon a pair of organs
 
  were they anything more apt to 
  discharge even the common offices of life
  invite a wise man to a feast 
  and he ll spoil the company
  either with morose silence or troublesome 
  disputes
  take him out to dance
  and you ll swear 
 a cow would have done 
  it better
 
  bring him to the theatre
  and his very looks are enough to 
  spoil all
  till like cato he take an occasion of withdrawing rather than 
  put off his supercilious gravity
  let him fall into discourse
  and he 
  shall make more sudden stops than if he had a wolf before him
  let him 
  buy
  or sell
  or in short go about any of those things without there is 
  no living in this world
  and you ll say this piece of wisdom were rather 
  a stock than a man
  of so little use is he to himself
  country
  or 
  friends
  and all because he is wholly ignorant of common things and lives 
  a course of life quite different from the people
  by which means it is 
  impossible but that he contract a popular odium
  to wit
  by reason of the 
  great diversity of their life and souls
  for what is there at all done 
  among men that is not full of folly
  and that too from fools and to 
  fools
  against which universal practice if any single one shall dare to 
  set up his throat
  my advice to him is
  that following the example of 
  timon
  he retire into some desert and there enjoy his wisdom to himself
  
   
  but
  to return to my design
  what power was it that drew those stony
  
  oaken
  and wild people into cities but flattery
  for nothing else is 
  signified by amphion and orpheus  harp
  what was it that
  when the common 
  people of rome were like to have destroyed all by their mutiny
  reduced 
  them to obedience
  was it a philosophical oration
  least
  but a 
  ridiculous and childish fable of the belly and the rest of the members
  
  and as good success had themistocles in his of the fox and hedgehog
  what 
  wise man s oration could ever have done so much with the people as 
  sertorius  invention of his white hind
  or his ridiculous emblem of 
  pulling off a horse s tail hair by hair
  or as lycurgus his example of 
  his two whelps
  to say nothing of minos and numa
  both which ruled their 
  foolish multitudes with fabulous inventions
  with which kind of toys that 
  great and powerful beast
  the people
  are led anyway
  again what city 
  ever received plato s or aristotle s laws
  or socrates  precepts
  but
  on 
  the contrary
  what made the decii devote themselves to the infernal gods
  
  or q
  curtius to leap into the gulf
  but an empty vainglory
  a most 
  bewitching siren
  and yet  tis strange it should be so condemned by those 
  wise philosophers
  for what is more foolish
  say they
  than for a 
  suppliant suitor to flatter the people
  to buy their favor with gifts
  to 
  court the applauses of so many fools
  to please himself with their 
  acclamations
  to be carried on the people s shoulders as in triumph
  and 
  have a brazen statue in the marketplace
  add to this the adoption of 
  names and surnames
  those divine honors given to a man of no reputation
  
  and the deification of the most wicked tyrants with public ceremonies
  
  most foolish things
  and such as one democritus is too little to laugh 
  at
  who denies it
  and yet from this root sprang all the great acts of 
  the heroes which the pens of so many eloquent men have extolled to the 
  skies
  in a word
  this folly is that that laid the foundation of cities
  
  and by it
  empire
  authority
  religion
  policy
  and public actions are 
  preserved
  neither is there anything in human life that is not a kind of 
  pastime of folly
  
   
  but to speak of arts
  what set men s wits on work to invent and transmit 
  to posterity so many famous
  as they conceive
  pieces of learning but the 
  thirst of glory
  with so much loss of sleep
  such pains and travail
  
  have the most foolish of men thought to purchase themselves a kind of 
  i know not what fame
  than which nothing can be more vain
  and yet 
  notwithstanding
  you owe this advantage to folly
  and which is the 
  most delectable of all other
  that you reap the benefit of other 
  men s madness
  
   
  and now
  having vindicated to myself the praise of fortitude and 
  industry
  what think you if i do the same by that of prudence
  but some 
  will say
  you may as well join fire and water
  it may be so
  but yet i 
  doubt not but to succeed even in this also
  if
  as you have done 
  hitherto
  you will but favor me with your attention
  and first
  if 
  prudence depends upon experience
  to whom is the honor of that name more 
  proper
  to the wise man
  who partly out of modesty and partly distrust of 
  himself
  attempts nothing
  or the fool
  whom neither modesty which he 
  never had
  nor danger which he never considers
  can discourage from 
  anything
  the wise man has recourse to the books of the ancients
  and 
  from thence picks nothing but subtleties of words
  the fool
  in 
  undertaking and venturing on the business of the world
  gathers
  if i 
  mistake not
  the true prudence
  such as homer though blind may be said to 
  have seen when he said
  
 the burnt child dreads the fire
 
  for there are 
  two main obstacles to the knowledge of things
  modesty that casts a mist 
  before the understanding
  and fear that
  having fancied a danger
  
  dissuades us from the attempt
  but from these folly sufficiently frees 
  us
  and few there are that rightly understand of what great advantage it 
  is to blush at nothing and attempt everything
  
   
  but if you had rather take prudence for that that consists in the 
  judgment of things
  hear me
  i beseech you
  how far they are from it that 
  yet crack of the name
  for first  tis evident that all human things
  like 
  alcibiades  sileni or rural gods
  carry a double face
  but not the least 
  alike
  so that what at first sight seems to be death
  if you view it 
  narrowly may prove to be life
  and so the contrary
  what appears 
  beautiful may chance to be deformed
  what wealthy
  a very beggar
  what 
  infamous
  praiseworthy
  what learned
  a dunce
  what lusty
  feeble
  what 
  jocund
  sad
  what noble
  base
  what lucky
  unfortunate
  what friendly
  an 
  enemy
  and what healthful
  noisome
  in short
  view the inside of these 
  sileni
  and you ll find them quite other than what they appear
  which
  if 
  perhaps it shall not seem so philosophically spoken
  i ll make it plain 
  to you 
 after my blunt way
 
  who would not conceive a prince a great lord 
  and abundant in everything
  but yet being so ill furnished with the gifts 
  of the mind
  and ever thinking he shall never have enough
  he s the 
  poorest of all men
  and then for his mind so given up to vice
   tis a 
  shame how it enslaves him
  i might in like manner philosophize of the 
  rest
  but let this one
  for example s sake
  be enough
  
   
  yet why this
  will someone say
  have patience
  and i ll show you what i 
  drive at
  if anyone seeing a player acting his part on a stage should go 
  about to strip him of his disguise and show him to the people in his true 
  native form
  would he not
  think you
  not only spoil the whole design of 
  the play
  but deserve himself to be pelted off with stones as a 
  phantastical fool and one out of his wits
  but nothing is more common 
  with them than such changes
  the same person one while impersonating a 
  woman
  and another while a man
  now a youngster
  and by and by a grim 
  seignior
  now a king
  and presently a peasant
  now a god
  and in a trice 
  again an ordinary fellow
  but to discover this were to spoil all
  it 
  being the only thing that entertains the eyes of the spectators
  and what 
  is all this life but a kind of comedy
  wherein men walk up and down in 
  one another s disguises and act their respective parts
  till the 
  property man brings them back to the attiring house
  and yet he often 
  orders a different dress
  and makes him that came but just now off in the 
  robes of a king put on the rags of a beggar
  thus are all things 
  represented by counterfeit
  and yet without this there was no living
  
   
  and here if any wise man
  as it were dropped from heaven
  should start up 
  and cry
  this great thing whom the world looks upon for a god and i know 
  not what is not so much as a man
  for that like a beast he is led by his 
  passions
  but the worst of slaves
  inasmuch as he gives himself up 
  willingly to so many and such detestable masters
  again if he should bid 
  a man that were bewailing the death of his father to laugh
  for that he 
  now began to live by having got an estate
  without which life is but a 
  kind of death
  or call another that were boasting of his family ill 
  begotten or base
  because he is so far removed from virtue that is the 
  only fountain of nobility
  and so of the rest
  what else would he get by 
  it but be thought himself mad and frantic
  for as nothing is more foolish 
  than preposterous wisdom
  so nothing is more unadvised than a forward 
  unseasonable prudence
  and such is his that does not comply with the 
  present time 
 and order himself as the market goes
 
  but forgetting that 
  law of feasts
  
 either drink or begone
 
  undertakes to disprove a common 
  received opinion
  whereas on the contrary  tis the part of a truly 
  prudent man not to be wise beyond his condition
  but either to take no 
  notice of what the world does
  or run with it for company
  but this is 
  foolish
  you ll say
  nor shall i deny it
  provided always you be so civil 
  on the other side as to confess that this is to act a part in that world
  
   
  but
  o you gods
  
 shall i speak or hold my tongue
 
  but why should i be 
  silent in a thing that is more true than truth itself
  however it might 
  not be amiss perhaps in so great an affair to call forth the muses from 
  helicon
  since the poets so often invoke them upon every foolish 
  occasion
  be present then awhile
  and assist me
  you daughters of 
  jupiter
  while i make it out that there is no way to that so much famed 
  wisdom
  nor access to that fortress as they call it of happiness
  but 
  under the banner of folly
  and first  tis agreed of all hands that our 
  passions belong to folly
  inasmuch as we judge a wise man from a fool by 
  this
  that the one is ordered by them
  the other by reason
  and therefore 
  the stoics remove from a wise man all disturbances of mind as so many 
  diseases
  but these passions do not only the office of a tutor to such as 
  are making towards the port of wisdom
  but are in every exercise of 
  virtue as it were spurs and incentives
  nay and encouragers to well 
  doing
  which though that great stoic seneca most strongly denies
  and 
  takes from a wise man all affections whatever
  yet in doing that he 
  leaves him not so much as a man but rather a new kind of god that was 
  never yet nor ever like to be
  nay
  to speak plainer
  he sets up a stony 
  semblance of a man
  void of all sense and common feeling of humanity
  and 
  much good to them with this wise man of theirs
  let them enjoy him to 
  themselves
  love him without competitors
  and live with him in plato s 
  commonwealth
  the country of ideas
  or tantalus  orchards
  for who would 
  not shun and startle at such a man
  as at some unnatural accident or 
  spirit
  a man dead to all sense of nature and common affections
  and no 
  more moved with love or pity than if he were a flint or rock
  whose 
  censure nothing escapes
  that commits no errors himself
  but has a lynx s 
  eyes upon others
  measures everything by an exact line
  and forgives 
  nothing
  pleases himself with himself only
  the only rich
  the only wise
  
  the only free man
  and only king
  in brief
  the only man that is 
  everything
  but in his own single judgment only
  that cares not for the 
  friendship of any man
  being himself a friend to no man
  makes no doubt 
  to make the gods stoop to him
  and condemns and laughs at the whole 
  actions of our life
  and yet such a beast is this their perfect wise man
  
  but tell me pray
  if the thing were to be carried by most voices
  what 
  city would choose him for its governor
  or what army desire him for their 
  general
  what woman would have such a husband
  what goodfellow such a 
  guest
  or what servant would either wish or endure such a master
  nay
  
  who had not rather have one of the middle sort of fools
  who
  being a 
  fool himself
  may the better know how to command or obey fools
  and who 
  though he please his like
   tis yet the greater number
  one that is kind 
  to his wife
  merry among his friends
  a boon companion
  and easy to be 
  lived with
  and lastly one that thinks nothing of humanity should be a 
  stranger to him
  but i am weary of this wise man
  and therefore i ll 
  proceed to some other advantages
  
   
  go to then
  suppose a man in some lofty high tower
  and that he could 
  look round him
  as the poets say jupiter was now and then wont
  to how 
  many misfortunes would he find the life of man subject
  how miserable
  to 
  say no worse
  our birth
  how difficult our education
  to how many wrongs 
  our childhood exposed
  to what pains our youth
  how unsupportable our old 
  age
  and grievous our unavoidable death
  as also what troops of diseases 
  beset us
  how many casualties hang over our heads
  how many troubles 
  invade us
  and how little there is that is not steeped in gall
  to say 
  nothing of those evils one man brings upon another
  as poverty
  
  imprisonment
  infamy
  dishonesty
  racks
  snares
  treachery
  reproaches
  
  actions
  deceits  but i m got into as endless a work as numbering the 
  sands  for what offenses mankind have deserved these things
  or what 
  angry god compelled them to be born into such miseries is not my present 
  business
  yet he that shall diligently examine it with himself
  would he 
  not
  think you
  approve the example of the milesian virgins and kill 
  himself
  but who are they that for no other reason but that they were 
  weary of life have hastened their own fate
  were they not the next 
  neighbors to wisdom
  among whom
  to say nothing of diogenes
  xenocrates
  
  cato
  cassius
  brutus
  that wise man chiron
  being offered immortality
  
  chose rather to die than be troubled with the same thing always
  
   
  and now i think you see what would become of the world if all men should 
  be wise
  to wit it were necessary we got another kind of clay and some 
  better potter
  but i
  partly through ignorance
  partly unadvisedness
  and 
  sometimes through forgetfulness of evil
  do now and then so sprinkle 
  pleasure with the hopes of good and sweeten men up in their greatest 
  misfortunes that they are not willing to leave this life
  even then when 
  according to the account of the destinies this life has left them
  and by 
  how much the less reason they have to live
  by so much the more they 
  desire it
  so far are they from being sensible of the least wearisomeness 
  of life
  of my gift it is
  that you have so many old nestors everywhere 
  that have scarce left them so much as the shape of a man
  stutterers
  
  dotards
  toothless
  gray haired
  bald
  or rather
  to use the words of 
  aristophanes
  
 nasty
  crumpled
  miserable
  shriveled
  bald
  toothless
  
  and wanting their baubles
 
  yet so delighted with life and to be thought 
  young that one dyes his gray hairs
  another covers his baldness with a 
  periwig
  another gets a set of new teeth
  another falls desperately in 
  love with a young wench and keeps more flickering about her than a young 
  man would have been ashamed of
  for to see such an old crooked piece with 
  one foot in the grave to marry a plump young wench
  and that too without 
  a portion
  is so common that men almost expect to be commended for it
  
  but the best sport of all is to see our old women
  even dead with age
  
  and such skeletons one would think they had stolen out of their graves
  
  and ever mumbling in their mouths
  
 life is sweet
 
  and as old as they 
  are
  still caterwauling
  daily plastering their face
  scarce ever from 
  the glass
  gossiping
  dancing
  and writing love letters
  these things are 
  laughed at as foolish
  as indeed they are
  yet they please themselves
  
  live merrily
  swim in pleasure
  and in a word are happy
  by my courtesy
  
  but i would have them to whom these things seem ridiculous to consider 
  with themselves whether it be not better to live so pleasant a life in 
  such kind of follies
  than
  as the proverb goes
  
 to take a halter and 
  hang themselves
 
  besides though these things may be subject to censure
  
  it concerns not my fools in the least
  inasmuch as they take no notice of 
  it
  or if they do
  they easily neglect it
  if a stone fall upon a man s 
  head
  that s evil indeed
  but dishonesty
  infamy
  villainy
  ill reports 
  carry no more hurt in them than a man is sensible of
  and if a man have 
  no sense of them
  they are no longer evils
  what are you the worse if the 
  people hiss at you
  so you applaud yourself
  and that a man be able to do 
  so
  he must owe it to folly
  
   
  but methinks i hear the philosophers opposing it and saying  tis a 
  miserable thing for a man to be foolish
  to err
  mistake
  and know 
  nothing truly
  nay rather
  this is to be a man
  and why they should call 
  it miserable
  i see no reason
  forasmuch as we are so born
  so bred
  so 
  instructed
  nay such is the common condition of us all
  and nothing can 
  be called miserable that suits with its kind
  unless perhaps you ll think 
  a man such because he can neither fly with birds
  nor walk on all four 
  with beasts
  and is not armed with horns as a bull
  for by the same 
  reason he would call the warlike horse unfortunate
  because he understood 
  not grammar
  nor ate cheese cakes
  and the bull miserable
  because he d 
  make so ill a wrestler
  and therefore
  as a horse that has no skill in 
  grammar is not miserable
  no more is man in this respect
  for that they 
  agree with his nature
  but again
  the virtuosi may say that there was 
  particularly added to man the knowledge of sciences
  by whose help he 
  might recompense himself in understanding for what nature cut him short 
  in other things
  as if this had the least face of truth
  that nature that 
  was so solicitously watchful in the production of gnats
  herbs
  and 
  flowers should have so slept when she made man
  that he should have need 
  to be helped by sciences
  which that old devil theuth
  the evil genius of 
  mankind
  first invented for his destruction
  and are so little conducive 
  to happiness that they rather obstruct it
  to which purpose they are 
  properly said to be first found out
  as that wise king in plato argues 
  touching the invention of letters
  
   
  sciences therefore crept into the world with other the pests of mankind
  
  from the same head from whence all other mischiefs spring
  we ll suppose 
  it devils
  for so the name imports when you call them demons
  that is to 
  say
  knowing
  for that simple people of the golden age
  being wholly 
  ignorant of everything called learning
  lived only by the guidance and 
  dictates of nature
  for what use of grammar
  where every man spoke the 
  same language and had no further design than to understand one another
  
  what use of logic
  where there was no bickering about the double meaning 
  words
  what need of rhetoric
  where there were no lawsuits
  or to what 
  purpose laws
  where there were no ill manners
  from which without doubt 
  good laws first came
  besides
  they were more religious than with an 
  impious curiosity to dive into the secrets of nature
  the dimension of 
  stars
  the motions
  effects
  and hidden causes of things
  as believing it 
  a crime for any man to attempt to be wise beyond his condition
  and as to 
  the inquiry of what was beyond heaven
  that madness never came into their 
  heads
  but the purity of the golden age declining by degrees
  first
  as i 
  said before
  arts were invented by the evil genii
  and yet but few
  and 
  those too received by fewer
  after that the chaldean superstition and 
  greek newfangledness
  that had little to do
  added i know not how many 
  more
  mere torments of wit
  and that so great that even grammar alone is 
  work enough for any man for his whole life
  
   
  though yet among these sciences those only are in esteem that come 
  nearest to common sense
  that is to say
  folly
  divines are half starved
  
  naturalists out of heart
  astrologers laughed at
  and logicians slighted
  
  only the physician is worth all the rest
  and among them too
  the more 
  unlearned
  impudent
  or unadvised he is
  the more he is esteemed
  even 
  among princes
  for physic
  especially as it is now professed by most men
  
  is nothing but a branch of flattery
  no less than rhetoric
  next them
  
  the second place is given to our law drivers
  if not the first
  whose 
  profession
  though i say it myself
  most men laugh at as the ass of 
  philosophy
  yet there s scarce any business
  either so great or so small
  
  but is managed by these asses
  these purchase their great lordships
  
  while in the meantime the divine
  having run through the whole body of 
  divinity
  sits gnawing a radish and is in continual warfare with lice and 
  fleas
  as therefore those arts are best that have the nearest affinity 
  with folly
  so are they most happy of all others that have least commerce 
  with sciences and follow the guidance of nature
  who is in no wise 
  imperfect
  unless perhaps we endeavor to leap over those bounds she has 
  appointed to us
  nature hates all false coloring and is ever best where 
  she is least adulterated with art
  
   
  go to then
  don t you find among the several kinds of living creatures 
  that they thrive best that understand no more than what nature taught 
  them
  what is more prosperous or wonderful than the bee
  and though they 
  have not the same judgment of sense as other bodies have
  yet wherein has 
  architecture gone beyond their building of houses
  what philosopher ever 
  founded the like republic
  whereas the horse
  that comes so near man in 
  understanding and is therefore so familiar with him
  is also partaker of 
  his misery
  for while he thinks it a shame to lose the race
  it often 
  happens that he cracks his wind
  and in the battle
  while he contends for 
  victory
  he s cut down himself
  and
  together with his rider 
 lies biting 
  the earth
 
  not to mention those strong bits
  sharp spurs
  close stables
  
  arms
  blows
  rider
  and briefly
  all that slavery he willingly submits 
  to
  while
  imitating those men of valor
  he so eagerly strives to be 
  revenged of the enemy
  than which how much more were the life of flies or 
  birds to be wished for
  who living by the instinct of nature
  look no 
  further than the present
  if yet man would but let them alone in it
  and 
  if at anytime they chance to be taken
  and being shut up in cages 
  endeavor to imitate our speaking
   tis strange how they degenerate from 
  their native gaiety
  so much better in every respect are the works of 
  nature than the adulteries of art
  
   
  in like manner i can never sufficiently praise that pythagoras in a 
  dunghill cock
  who being but one had been yet everything
  a philosopher
  
  a man
  a woman
  a king
  a private man
  a fish
  a horse
  a frog
  and
  i 
  believe too
  a sponge
  and at last concluded that no creature was more 
  miserable than man
  for that all other creatures are content with those 
  bounds that nature set them
  only man endeavors to exceed them
  and 
  again
  among men he gives the precedency not to the learned or the great
  
  but the fool
  nor had that gryllus less wit than ulysses with his many 
  counsels
  who chose rather to lie grunting in a hog sty than be exposed 
  with the other to so many hazards
  nor does homer
  that father of 
  trifles
  dissent from me
  who not only called all men 
 wretched and full 
  of calamity
 
  but often his great pattern of wisdom
  ulysses
  
  
 miserable
 
  paris
  ajax
  and achilles nowhere
  and why
  i pray but that
  
  like a cunning fellow and one that was his craft s master
  he did nothing 
  without the advice of pallas
  in a word he was too wise
  and by that 
  means ran wide of nature
  as therefore among men they are least happy 
  that study wisdom
  as being in this twice fools
  that when they are born 
  men
  they should yet so far forget their condition as to affect the life 
  of gods
  and after the example of the giants
  with their philosophical 
  gimcracks make a war upon nature
  so they on the other side seem as 
  little miserable as is possible who come nearest to beasts and never 
  attempt anything beyond man
  go to then
  let s try how demonstrable this 
  is
  not by enthymemes or the imperfect syllogisms of the stoics
  but by 
  plain
  downright
  and ordinary examples
  
   
  and now
  by the immortal gods
  i think nothing more happy than that 
  generation of men we commonly call fools
  idiots
  lack wits
  and dolts
  
  splendid titles too
  as i conceive them
  i ll tell you a thing
  which at 
  first perhaps may seem foolish and absurd
  yet nothing more true
  and 
  first they are not afraid of death  no small evil
  by jupiter
  they are 
  not tormented with the conscience of evil acts
  not terrified with the 
  fables of ghosts
  nor frightened with spirits and goblins
  they are not 
  distracted with the fear of evils to come nor the hopes of future good
  
  in short
  they are not disturbed with those thousand of cares to which 
  this life is subject
  they are neither modest
  nor fearful
  nor 
  ambitious
  nor envious
  nor love they any man
  and lastly
  if they should 
  come nearer even to the very ignorance of brutes
  they could not sin
  for 
  so hold the divines
  and now tell me
  you wise fool
  with how many 
  troublesome cares your mind is continually perplexed
  heap together all 
  the discommodities of your life
  and then you ll be sensible from how 
  many evils i have delivered my fools
  add to this that they are not only 
  merry
  play
  sing
  and laugh themselves
  but make mirth wherever they 
  come
  a special privilege it seems the gods have given them to refresh 
  the pensiveness of life
  whence it is that whereas the world is so 
  differently affected one towards another
  that all men indifferently 
  admit them as their companions
  desire
  feed
  cherish
  embrace them
  take 
  their parts upon all occasions
  and permit them without offense to do or 
  say what they like
  and so little does everything desire to hurt them
  
  that even the very beasts
  by a kind of natural instinct of their 
  innocence no doubt
  pass by their injuries
  for of them it may be truly 
  said that they are consecrate to the gods
  and therefore and not without 
  cause do men have them in such esteem
  whence is it else that they are in 
  so great request with princes that they can neither eat nor drink
  go 
  anywhere
  or be an hour without them
  nay
  and in some degree they prefer 
  these fools before their crabbish wise men
  whom yet they keep about them 
  for state s sake
  nor do i conceive the reason so difficult
  or that it 
  should seem strange why they are preferred before the others
  for that 
  these wise men speak to princes about nothing but grave
  serious matters
  
  and trusting to their own parts and learning do not fear sometimes 
 to 
  grate their tender ears with smart truths
 
  but fools fit them with that 
  they most delight in
  as jests
  laughter
  abuses of other men
  wanton 
  pastimes
  and the like
  
   
  again
  take notice of this no contemptible blessing which nature has 
  given fools
  that they are the only plain
  honest men and such as speak 
  truth
  and what is more commendable than truth
  for though that proverb 
  of alcibiades in plato attributes truth to drunkards and children
  yet 
  the praise of it is particularly mine
  even from the testimony of 
  euripides
  among whose other things there is extant that his honorable 
  saying concerning us
  
 a fool speaks foolish things
 
  for whatever a fool 
  has in his heart
  he both shows it in his looks and expresses it in his 
  discourse
  while the wise men s are those two tongues which the same 
  euripides mentions
  whereof the one speaks truth
  the other what they 
  judge most seasonable for the occasion
  these are they 
 that turn black 
  into white
 
  blow hot and cold with the same breath
  and carry a far 
  different meaning in their breast from what they feign with their tongue
  
  yet in the midst of all their prosperity
  princes in this respect seem to 
  me most unfortunate
  because
  having no one to tell them truth
  they are 
  forced to receive flatterers for friends
  
   
  but
  someone may say
  the ears of princes are strangers to truth
  and for 
  this reason they avoid those wise men
  because they fear lest someone 
  more frank than the rest should dare to speak to them things rather true 
  than pleasant
  for so the matter is
  that they don t much care for truth
  
  and yet this is found by experience among my fools
  that not only truths 
  but even open reproaches are heard with pleasure
  so that the same thing 
  which
  if it came from a wise man s mouth might prove a capital crime
  
  spoken by a fool is received with delight
  for truth carries with it a 
  certain peculiar power of pleasing
  if no accident fall in to give 
  occasion of offense
  which faculty the gods have given only to fools
  and 
  for the same reasons is it that women are so earnestly delighted with 
  this kind of men
  as being more propense by nature to pleasure and toys
  
  and whatsoever they may happen to do with them
  although sometimes it be 
  of the most serious
  yet they turn it to jest and laughter
  as that sex 
  was ever quick witted
  especially to color their own faults
  
   
  but to return to the happiness of fools
  who when they have passed over 
  this life with a great deal of pleasantness and without so much as the 
  least fear or sense of death
  they go straight forth into the elysian 
  field
  to recreate their pious and careless souls with such sports as 
  they used here
  let s proceed then
  and compare the condition of any of 
  your wise men with that of this fool
  fancy to me now some example of 
  wisdom you d set up against him
  one that had spent his childhood and 
  youth in learning the sciences and lost the sweetest part of his life in 
  watchings
  cares
  studies
  and for the remaining part of it never so much 
  as tasted the least of pleasure
  ever sparing
  poor
  sad
  sour
  unjust
  
  and rigorous to himself
  and troublesome and hateful to others
  broken 
  with paleness
  leanness
  crassness
  sore eyes
  and an old age and death 
  contracted before their time  though yet
  what matter is it
  when he die 
  that never lived
  
  and such is the picture of this great wise man
  
   
  and here again do those frogs of the stoics croak at me and say that 
  nothing is more miserable than madness
  but folly is the next degree
  if 
  not the very thing
  for what else is madness than for a man to be out of 
  his wits
  but to let them see how they are clean out of the way
  with the 
  muses  good favor we ll take this syllogism in pieces
  subtly argued
  i 
  must confess
  but as socrates in plato teaches us how by splitting one 
  venus and one cupid to make two of either
  in like manner should those 
  logicians have done and distinguished madness from madness
  if at least 
  they would be thought to be well in their wits themselves
  for all 
  madness is not miserable
  or horace had never called his poetical fury a 
  beloved madness
  nor plato placed the raptures of poets
  prophets
  and 
  lovers among the chiefest blessings of this life
  nor that sibyl in 
  virgil called aeneas  travels mad labors
  but there are two sorts of 
  madness
  the one that which the revengeful furies send privily from hell
  
  as often as they let loose their snakes and put into men s breasts either 
  the desire of war
  or an insatiate thirst after gold
  or some dishonest 
  love
  or parricide
  or incest
  or sacrilege
  or the like plagues
  or when 
  they terrify some guilty soul with the conscience of his crimes
  the 
  other
  but nothing like this
  that which comes from me and is of all 
  other things the most desirable
  which happens as often as some pleasing 
  dotage not only clears the mind of its troublesome cares but renders it 
  more jocund
  and this was that which
  as a special blessing of the gods
  
  cicero
  writing to his friend atticus
  wished to himself
  that he might 
  be the less sensible of those miseries that then hung over the 
  commonwealth
  
   
  nor was that grecian in horace much wide of it
  who was so far made that 
  he would sit by himself whole days in the theatre laughing and clapping 
  his hands
  as if he had seen some tragedy acting
  whereas in truth there 
  was nothing presented
  yet in other things a man well enough
  pleasant 
  among his friends
  kind to his wife
  and so good a master to his servants 
  that if they had broken the seal of his bottle
  he would not have run mad 
  for it
  but at last
  when by the care of his friends and physic he was 
  freed from his distemper and become his own man again
  he thus 
  expostulates with them
  
 now
  by pollux
  my friends
  you have rather 
  killed than preserved me in thus forcing me from my pleasure
 
  by which 
  you see he liked it so well that he lost it against his will
  and trust 
  me
  i think they were the madder of the two
  and had the greater need of 
  hellebore
  that should offer to look upon so pleasant a madness as an 
  evil to be removed by physic
  though yet i have not determined whether 
  every distemper of the sense or understanding be to be called madness
  
   
  for neither he that having weak eyes should take a mule for an ass
  nor 
  he that should admire an insipid poem as excellent would be presently 
  thought mad
  but he that not only errs in his senses but is deceived also 
  in his judgment
  and that too more than ordinary and upon all 
  occasions  he
  i must confess
  would be thought to come very near to it
  
  as if anyone hearing an ass bray should take it for excellent music
  or a 
  beggar conceive himself a king
  and yet this kind of madness
  if
  as it 
  commonly happens
  it turn to pleasure
  it brings a great delight not only 
  to them that are possessed with it but to those also that behold it
  
  though perhaps they may not be altogether so mad as the other
  for the 
  species of this madness is much larger than the people take it to be
  for 
  one mad man laughs at another
  and beget themselves a mutual pleasure
  
  nor does it seldom happen that he that is the more mad
  laughs at him 
  that is less mad
  and in this every man is the more happy in how many 
  respects the more he is mad
  and if i were judge in the case
  he should 
  be ranged in that class of folly that is peculiarly mine
  which in truth 
  is so large and universal that i scarce know anyone in all mankind that 
  is wise at all hours
  or has not some tang or other of madness
  
   
  and to this class do they appertain that slight everything in comparison 
  of hunting and protest they take an unimaginable pleasure to hear the 
  yell of the horns and the yelps of the hounds
  and i believe could pick 
  somewhat extraordinary out of their very excrement
  and then what 
  pleasure they take to see a buck or the like unlaced
  let ordinary 
  fellows cut up an ox or a wether
   twere a crime to have this done by 
  anything less than a gentleman
  who with his hat off
  on his bare knees
  
  and a couteau for that purpose  for every sword or knife is not 
  allowable 
  with a curious superstition and certain postures
  lays open 
  the several parts in their respective order
  while they that hem him in 
  admire it with silence
  as some new religious ceremony
  though perhaps 
  they have seen it a hundred times before
  and if any of them chance to 
  get the least piece of it
  he presently thinks himself no small 
  gentleman
  in all which they drive at nothing more than to become beasts 
  themselves
  while yet they imagine they live the life of princes
  
   
  and next these may be reckoned those that have such an itch of building
  
  one while changing rounds into squares
  and presently again squares into 
  rounds
  never knowing either measure or end
  till at last
  reduced to the 
  utmost poverty
  there remains not to them so much as a place where they 
  may lay their head
  or wherewith to fill their bellies
  and why all this
  
  but that they may pass over a few years in feeding their foolish fancies
  
   
  and
  in my opinion
  next these may be reckoned such as with their new 
  inventions and occult arts undertake to change the forms of things and 
  hunt all about after a certain fifth essence
  men so bewitched with this 
  present hope that it never repents them of their pains or expense
  but 
  are ever contriving how they may cheat themselves
  till
  having spent 
  all
  there is not enough left them to provide another furnace
  and yet 
  they have not done dreaming these their pleasant dreams but encourage 
  others
  as much as in them lies
  to the same happiness
  and at last
  when 
  they are quite lost in all their expectations
  they cheer up themselves 
  with this sentence
  
 in great things the very attempt is enough
 
  and 
  then complain of the shortness of man s life that is not sufficient for 
  so great an understanding
  
   
  and then for gamesters
  i am a little doubtful whether they are to be 
  admitted into our college
  and yet  tis a foolish and ridiculous sight to 
  see some addicted so to it that they can no sooner hear the rattling of 
  the dice but their heart leaps and dances again
  and then when time after 
  time they are so far drawn on with the hopes of winning that they have 
  made shipwreck of all
  and having split their ship on that rock of dice
  
  no less terrible than the bishop and his clerks
  scarce got alive to 
  shore
  they choose rather to cheat any man of their just debts than not 
  pay the money they lost
  lest otherwise
  forsooth
  they be thought no men 
  of their words
  again what is it
  i pray
  to see old fellows and half 
  blind to play with spectacles
  nay
  and when a justly deserved gout has 
  knotted their knuckles
  to hire a caster
  or one that may put the dice in 
  the box for them
  a pleasant thing
  i must confess
  did it not for the 
  most part end in quarrels
  and therefore belongs rather to the furies 
  than me
  
   
  but there is no doubt but that that kind of men are wholly ours who love 
  to hear or tell feigned miracles and strange lies and are never weary of 
  any tale
  though never so long
  so it be of ghosts
  spirits
  goblins
  
  devils
  or the like
  which the further they are from truth
  the more 
  readily they are believed and the more do they tickle their itching ears
  
  and these serve not only to pass away time but bring profit
  especially 
  to mass priests and pardoners
  and next to these are they that have 
  gotten a foolish but pleasant persuasion that if they can but see a 
  wooden or painted polypheme christopher
  they shall not die that day
  or 
  do but salute a carved barbara
  in the usual set form
  that he shall 
  return safe from battle
  or make his application to erasmus on certain 
  days with some small wax candles and proper prayers
  that he shall 
  quickly be rich
  nay
  they have gotten a hercules
  another hippolytus
  
  and a st
  george
  whose horse most religiously set out with trappings and 
  bosses there wants little but they worship
  however
  they endeavor to 
  make him their friend by some present or other
  and to swear by his 
  master s brazen helmet is an oath for a prince
  or what should i say of 
  them that hug themselves with their counterfeit pardons
  that have 
  measured purgatory by an hourglass
  and can without the least mistake 
  demonstrate its ages
  years
  months
  days
  hours
  minutes
  and seconds
  
  as it were in a mathematical table
  or what of those who
  having 
  confidence in certain magical charms and short prayers invented by some 
  pious imposter
  either for his soul s health or profit s sake
  promise to 
  themselves everything
  wealth
  honor
  pleasure
  plenty
  good health
  long 
  life
  lively old age
  and the next place to christ in the other world
  
  which yet they desire may not happen too soon
  that is to say before the 
  pleasures of this life have left them
  
   
  and now suppose some merchant
  soldier
  or judge
  out of so many rapines
  
  parts with some small piece of money
  he straight conceives all that sink 
  of his whole life quite cleansed
  so many perjuries
  so many lusts
  so 
  many debaucheries
  so many contentions
  so many murders
  so many deceits
  
  so many breaches of trusts
  so many treacheries bought off
  as it were by 
  compact
  and so bought off that they may begin upon a new score
  but what 
  is more foolish than those
  or rather more happy
  who daily reciting 
  those seven verses of the psalms promise to themselves more than the top 
  of felicity
  which magical verses some devil or other
  a merry one 
  without doubt but more a blab of his tongue than crafty
  is believed to 
  have discovered to st
  bernard
  but not without a trick
  and these are so 
  foolish that i am half ashamed of them myself
  and yet they are approved
  
  and that not only by the common people but even the professors of 
  religion
  and what
  are not they also almost the same where several 
  countries avouch to themselves their peculiar saint
  and as everyone of 
  them has his particular gift
  so also his particular form of worship
  as
  
  one is good for the toothache
  another for groaning women
  a third
  for 
  stolen goods
  a fourth
  for making a voyage prosperous
  and a fifth
  to 
  cure sheep of the rot
  and so of the rest
  for it would be too tedious to 
  run over all
  and some there are that are good for more things than one
  
  but chiefly
  the virgin mother
  to whom the common people do in a manner 
  attribute more than to the son
  
   
  yet what do they beg of these saints but what belongs to folly
  to 
  examine it a little
  among all those offerings which are so frequently 
  hung up in churches
  nay up to the very roof of some of them
  did you 
  ever see the least acknowledgment from anyone that had left his folly
  or 
  grown a hair s breadth the wiser
  one escapes a shipwreck
  and he gets 
  safe to shore
  another
  run through in a duel
  recovers
  another
  while 
  the rest were fighting
  ran out of the field
  no less luckily than 
  valiantly
  another
  condemned to be hanged
  by the favor of some saint or 
  other
  a friend to thieves
  got off himself by impeaching his fellows
  
  another escaped by breaking prison
  another recovered from his fever in 
  spite of his physician
  another s poison turning to a looseness proved 
  his remedy rather than death
  and that to his wife s no small sorrow
  in 
  that she lost both her labor and her charge
  another s cart broke
  and he 
  saved his horses
  another preserved from the fall of a house
  all these 
  hang up their tablets
  but no one gives thanks for his recovery from 
  folly
  so sweet a thing it is not to be wise
  that on the contrary men 
  rather pray against anything than folly
  
   
  but why do i launch out into this ocean of superstitions
  had i a hundred 
  tongues
  as many mouths
  and a voice never so strong
  yet were i not able 
  to run over the several sorts of fools or all the names of folly
  so 
  thick do they swarm everywhere
  and yet your priests make no scruple to 
  receive and cherish them as proper instruments of profit
  whereas if some 
  scurvy wise fellow should step up and speak things as they are
  as
  to 
  live well is the way to die well
  the best way to get quit of sin is to 
  add to the money you give the hatred of sin
  tears
  watchings
  prayers
  
  fastings
  and amendment of life
  such or such a saint will favor you
  if 
  you imitate his life  these
  i say
  and the like  should this wise man 
  chat to the people
  from what happiness into how great troubles would he 
  draw them
  
   
  of this college also are they who in their lifetime appoint with what 
  solemnity they ll be buried
  and particularly set down how many torches
  
  how many mourners
  how many singers
  how many almsmen they will have at 
  it
  as if any sense of it could come to them
  or that it were a shame to 
  them that their corpse were not honorably interred
  so curious are they 
  herein
  as if
  like the aediles of old
  these were to present some shows 
  or banquet to the people
  
   
  and though i am in haste
  yet i cannot yet pass by them who
  though they 
  differ nothing from the meanest cobbler
  yet  tis scarcely credible how 
  they flatter themselves with the empty title of nobility
  one derives his 
  pedigree from aeneas
  another from brutus
  a third from the star by the 
  tail of ursa major
  they show you on every side the statues and pictures 
  of their ancestors
  run over their great grandfathers and the 
  great great grandfathers of both lines
  and the ancient matches of their 
  families
  when themselves yet are but once removed from a statue
  if not 
  worse than those trifles they boast of
  and yet by means of this pleasant 
  self love they live a happy life
  nor are they less fools who admire 
  these beasts as if they were gods
  
   
  but what do i speak of any one or the other particular kind of men
  as if 
  this self love had not the same effect everywhere and rendered most men 
  superabundantly happy
  as when a fellow
  more deformed than a baboon
  
  shall believe himself handsomer than homer s nereus
  another
  as soon as 
  he can draw two or three lines with a compass
  presently thinks himself a 
  euclid
  a third
  that understands music no more than my horse
  and for 
  his voice as hoarse as a dunghill cock
  shall yet conceive himself 
  another hermogenes
  but of all madness that s the most pleasant when a 
  man
  seeing another any way excellent in what he pretends to himself
  
  makes his boasts of it as confidently as if it were his own
  and such was 
  that rich fellow in seneca
  who whenever he told a story had his servants 
  at his elbow to prompt him the names
  and to that height had they 
  flattered him that he did not question but he might venture a rubber at 
  cuffs
  a man otherwise so weak he could scarce stand
  only presuming on 
  this
  that he had a company of sturdy servants about him
  
   
  or to what purpose is it i should mind you of our professors of arts
  
  forasmuch as this self love is so natural to them all that they had 
  rather part with their father s land than their foolish opinions
  but 
  chiefly players
  fiddlers
  orators
  and poets
  of which the more ignorant 
  each of them is
  the more insolently he pleases himself
  that is to say 
  vaunts and spreads out his plumes
  and like lips find like lettuce
  nay
  
  the more foolish anything is
  the more  tis admired
  the greater number 
  being ever tickled at the worst things
  because
  as i said before
  most 
  men are so subject to folly
  and therefore if the more foolish a man is
  
  the more he pleases himself and is admired by others
  to what purpose 
  should he beat his brains about true knowledge
  which first will cost him 
  dear
  and next render him the more troublesome and less confident
  and 
  lastly
  please only a few
  
   
  and now i consider it
  nature has planted
  not only in particular men but 
  even in every nation
  and scarce any city is there without it
  a kind of 
  common self love
  and hence is it that the english
  besides other things
  
  particularly challenge to themselves beauty
  music
  and feasting
  the 
  scots are proud of their nobility
  alliance to the crown
  and logical 
  subtleties
  the french think themselves the only well bred men
  the 
  parisians
  excluding all others
  arrogate to themselves the only 
  knowledge of divinity
  the italians affirm they are the only masters of 
  good letters and eloquence
  and flatter themselves on this account
  that 
  of all others they only are not barbarous
  in which kind of happiness 
  those of rome claim the first place
  still dreaming to themselves of 
  somewhat
  i know not what
  of old rome
  the venetians fancy themselves 
  happy in the opinion of their nobility
  the greeks
  as if they were the 
  only authors of sciences
  swell themselves with the titles of the ancient 
  heroes
  the turk
  and all that sink of the truly barbarous
  challenge to 
  themselves the only glory of religion and laugh at christians as 
  superstitious
  and much more pleasantly the jews expect to this day the 
  coming of the messiah
  and so obstinately contend for their law of moses
  
  the spaniards give place to none in the reputation of soldiery
  the 
  germans pride themselves in their tallness of stature and skill in magic
  
   
  and
  not to instance in every particular
  you see
  i conceive
  how much 
  satisfaction this self love
  who has a sister also not unlike herself 
  called flattery
  begets everywhere
  for self love is no more than the 
  soothing of a man s self
  which
  done to another
  is flattery
  and though 
  perhaps at this day it may be thought infamous
  yet it is so only with 
  them that are more taken with words than things
  they think truth is 
  inconsistent with flattery
  but that it is much otherwise we may learn 
  from the examples of true beasts
  what more fawning than a dog
  and yet 
  what more trusty
  what has more of those little tricks than a squirrel
  
  and yet what more loving to man
  unless
  perhaps you ll say
  men had 
  better converse with fierce lions
  merciless tigers
  and furious 
  leopards
  for that flattery is the most pernicious of all things
  by 
  means of which some treacherous persons and mockers have run the 
  credulous into such mischief
  but this of mine proceeds from a certain 
  gentleness and uprightness of mind and comes nearer to virtue than its 
  opposite
  austerity
  or a morose and troublesome peevishness
  as horace 
  calls it
  this supports the dejected
  relieves the distressed
  encourages 
  the fainting
  awakens the stupid
  refreshes the sick
  supplies the 
  untractable
  joins loves together
  and keeps them so joined
  it entices 
  children to take their learning
  makes old men frolic
  and
  under the 
  color of praise
  does without offense both tell princes their faults and 
  show them the way to amend them
  in short
  it makes every man the more 
  jocund and acceptable to himself
  which is the chiefest point of 
  felicity
  again
  what is more friendly than when two horses scrub one 
  another
  and to say nothing of it
  that it s a main part of physic
  
  and the only thing in poetry
   tis the delight and relish of all 
  human society
  
   
  but  tis a sad thing
  they say
  to be mistaken
  nay rather
  he is most 
  miserable that is not so
  for they are quite beside the mark that place 
  the happiness of men in things themselves
  since it only depends upon 
  opinion
  for so great is the obscurity and variety of human affairs that 
  nothing can be clearly known
  as it is truly said by our academics
  the 
  least insolent of all the philosophers
  or if it could
  it would but 
  obstruct the pleasure of life
  lastly
  the mind of man is so framed that 
  it is rather taken with the false colors than truth
  of which if anyone 
  has a mind to make the experiment
  let him go to church and hear sermons
  
  in which if there be anything serious delivered
  the audience is either 
  asleep
  yawning
  or weary of it
  but if the preacher  pardon my mistake
  
  i would have said declaimer  as too often it happens
  fall but into an 
  old wives  story
  they re presently awake
  prick up their ears and gape 
  after it
  in like manner
  if there be any poetical saint
  or one of whom 
  there goes more stories than ordinary
  as for example
  a george
  a 
  christopher
  or a barbara
  you shall see him more religiously worshiped 
  than peter
  paul
  or even christ himself
  but these things are not for 
  this place
  
   
  and now at how cheap a rate is this happiness purchased
  forasmuch as to 
  the thing itself a man s whole endeavor is required
  be it never so 
  inconsiderable
  but the opinion of it is easily taken up
  which yet 
  conduces as much or more to happiness
  for suppose a man were eating 
  rotten stockfish
  the very smell of which would choke another
  and yet 
  believed it a dish for the gods
  what difference is there as to his 
  happiness
  whereas on the contrary
  if another s stomach should turn at a 
  sturgeon
  wherein
  i pray
  is he happier than the other
  if a man have a 
  crooked
  ill favored wife
  who yet in his eye may stand in competition 
  with venus
  is it not the same as if she were truly beautiful
  or if 
  seeing an ugly
  ill pointed piece
  he should admire the work as believing 
  it some great master s hand
  were he not much happier
  think you
  than 
  they that buy such things at vast rates
  and yet perhaps reap less 
  pleasure from them than the other
  i know one of my name that gave his 
  new married wife some counterfeit jewels
  and as he was a pleasant droll
  
  persuaded her that they were not only right but of an inestimable price
  
  and what difference
  i pray
  to her
  that was as well pleased and 
  contented with glass and kept it as warily as if it had been a treasure
  
  in the meantime the husband saved his money and had this advantage of her 
  folly
  that he obliged her as much as if he had bought them at a great 
  rate
  or what difference
  think you
  between those in plato s imaginary 
  cave that stand gaping at the shadows and figures of things
  so they 
  please themselves and have no need to wish
  and that wise man
  who
  being 
  got loose from them
  sees things truly as they are
  whereas that cobbler 
  in lucian if he might always have continued his golden dreams
  he would 
  never have desired any other happiness
  so then there is no difference
  
  or
  if there be
  the fools have the advantage
  first
  in that their 
  happiness costs them least
  that is to say
  only some small persuasion
  
  next
  that they enjoy it in common
  and the possession of no good can be 
  delightful without a companion
  for who does not know what a dearth there 
  is of wise men
  if yet any one be to be found
  and though the greeks for 
  these so many ages have accounted upon seven only
  yet so help me 
  hercules
  do but examine them narrowly
  and i ll be hanged if you find 
  one half witted fellow
  nay or so much as one quarter of a wise man
  
  among them all
  
   
  for whereas among the many praises of bacchus they reckon this the chief
  
  that he washes away cares
  and that too in an instant
  do but sleep off 
  his weak spirits
  and they come on again
  as we say
  on horseback
  but 
  how much larger and more present is the benefit you receive by me
  since
  
  as it were with a perpetual drunkenness i fill your minds with mirth
  
  fancies
  and jollities
  and that too without any trouble
  nor is there 
  any man living whom i let be without it
  whereas the gifts of the gods 
  are scrambled
  some to one and some to another
  the sprightly delicious 
  wine that drives away cares and leaves such a flavor behind it grows not 
  everywhere
  beauty
  the gift of venus
  happens to few
  and to fewer gives 
  mercury eloquence
  hercules makes not everyone rich
  homer s jupiter 
  bestows not empire on all men
  mars oftentimes favors neither side
  many 
  return sad from apollo s oracle
  phoebus sometimes shoots a plague among 
  us
  neptune drowns more than he saves
  to say nothing of those 
  mischievous gods
  plutoes
  ates
  punishments
  favors
  and the like
  not 
  gods but executioners
  i am that only folly that so readily and 
  indifferently bestows my benefits on all
  nor do i look to be entreated
  
  or am i subject to take pet
  and require an expiatory sacrifice if some 
  ceremony be omitted
  nor do i beat heaven and earth together if
  when the 
  rest of the gods are invited
  i am passed by or not admitted to the 
  stream of their sacrifices
  for the rest of the gods are so curious in 
  this point that such an omission may chance to spoil a man s business
  
  and therefore one has as good even let them alone as worship them
  just 
  like some men
  who are so hard to please
  and withall so ready to do 
  mischief
  that  tis better be a stranger than have any familiarity 
  with them
  
   
  but no man
  you ll say
  ever sacrificed to folly or built me a temple
  
  and troth
  as i said before
  i cannot but wonder at the ingratitude
  yet 
  because i am easily to be entreated
  i take this also in good part
  
  though truly i can scarce request it
  for why should i require incense
  
  wafers
  a goat
  or sow when all men pay me that worship everywhere which 
  is so much approved even by our very divines
  unless perhaps i should 
  envy diana that her sacrifices are mingled with human blood
  then do i 
  conceive myself most religiously worshiped when everywhere
  as  tis 
  generally done
  men embrace me in their minds
  express me in their 
  manners
  and represent me in their lives
  which worship of the saints is 
  not so ordinary among christians
  how many are there that burn candles to 
  the virgin mother
  and that too at noonday when there s no need of them
  
  but how few are there that study to imitate her in pureness of life
  
  humility and love of heavenly things
  which is the true worship and most 
  acceptable to heaven
  besides why should i desire a temple when the whole 
  world is my temple
  and i m deceived or  tis a goodly one
  nor can i want 
  priests but in a land where there are no men
  nor am i yet so foolish as 
  to require statues or painted images
  which do often obstruct my worship
  
  since among the stupid and gross multitude those figures are worshiped 
  for the saints themselves
  and so it would fare with me
  as it does with 
  them that are turned out of doors by their substitutes
  no
  i have 
  statues enough
  and as many as there are men
  everyone bearing my lively 
  resemblance in his face
  how unwilling so ever he be to the contrary
  and 
  therefore there is no reason why i should envy the rest of the gods if in 
  particular places they have their particular worship
  and that too on set 
  days  as phoebus at rhodes
  at cyprus
  venus
  at argos
  juno
  at athens
  
  minerva
  in olympus
  jupiter
  at tarentum
  neptune
  and near the 
  hellespont
  priapus  as long as the world in general performs me every 
  day much better sacrifices
  
   
  wherein notwithstanding if i shall seem to anyone to have spoken more 
  boldly than truly
  let us
  if you please
  look a little into the lives of 
  men
  and it will easily appear not only how much they owe to me
  but how 
  much they esteem me even from the highest to the lowest
  and yet we will 
  not run over the lives of everyone
  for that would be too long
  but only 
  some few of the great ones
  from whence we shall easily conjecture the 
  rest
  for to what purpose is it to say anything of the common people
  who 
  without dispute are wholly mine
  for they abound everywhere with so many 
  several sorts of folly
  and are every day so busy in inventing new
  that 
  a thousand democriti are too few for so general a laughter though there 
  were another democritus to laugh at them too
   tis almost incredible what 
  sport and pastime they daily make the gods
  for though they set aside 
  their sober forenoon hours to dispatch business and receive prayers
  yet 
  when they begin to be well whittled with nectar and cannot think of 
  anything that s serious
  they get them up into some part of heaven that 
  has better prospect than other and thence look down upon the actions of 
  men
  nor is there anything that pleases them better
  good
  good
  what an 
  excellent sight it is
  how many several hurly burlies of fools
  for i 
  myself sometimes sit among those poetical gods
  
   
  here s one desperately in love with a young wench
  and the more she 
  slights him the more outrageously he loves her
  another marries a woman s 
  money
  not herself
  another s jealousy keeps more eyes on her than argos
  
  another becomes a mourner
  and how foolishly he carries it
  nay
  hires 
  others to bear him company to make it more ridiculous
  another weeps over 
  his mother in law s grave
  another spends all he can rap and run on his 
  belly
  to be the more hungry after it
  another thinks there is no 
  happiness but in sleep and idleness
  another turmoils himself about other 
  men s business and neglects his own
  another thinks himself rich in 
  taking up moneys and changing securities
  as we say borrowing of peter to 
  pay paul
  and in a short time becomes bankrupt
  another starves himself 
  to enrich his heir
  another for a small and uncertain gain exposes his 
  life to the casualties of seas and winds
  which yet no money can restore
  
  another had rather get riches by war than live peaceably at home
  and 
  some there are that think them easiest attained by courting old childless 
  men with presents
  and others again by making rich old women believe they 
  love them
  both which afford the gods most excellent pastime
  to see them 
  cheated by those persons they thought to have over caught
  but the most 
  foolish and basest of all others are our merchants
  to wit such as 
  venture on everything be it never so dishonest
  and manage it no better
  
  who though they lie by no allowance
  swear and forswear
  steal
  cozen
  
  and cheat
  yet shuffle themselves into the first rank
  and all because 
  they have gold rings on their fingers
  nor are they without their 
  flattering friars that admire them and give them openly the title of 
  honorable
  in hopes
  no doubt
  to get some small snip of it themselves
  
   
  there are also a kind of pythagoreans with whom all things are so common 
  that if they get anything under their cloaks
  they make no more scruple 
  of carrying it away than if it were their own by inheritance
  there are 
  others too that are only rich in conceit
  and while they fancy to 
  themselves pleasant dreams
  conceive that enough to make them happy
  some 
  desire to be accounted wealthy abroad and are yet ready to starve at 
  home
  one makes what haste he can to set all going
  and another rakes it 
  together by right or wrong
  this man is ever laboring for public honors
  
  and another lies sleeping in a chimney corner
  a great many undertake 
  endless suits and outvie one another who shall most enrich the dilatory 
  judge or corrupt advocate
  one is all for innovations and another for 
  some great he knows not what
  another leaves his wife and children at 
  home and goes to jerusalem
  rome
  or in pilgrimage to st
  james s where 
  he has no business
  in short
  if a man like menippus of old could look 
  down from the moon and behold those innumerable rufflings of mankind
  he 
  would think he saw a swarm of flies and gnats quarreling among 
  themselves
  fighting
  laying traps for one another
  snatching
  playing
  
  wantoning
  growing up
  falling
  and dying
  nor is it to be believed what 
  stir
  what broils
  this little creature raises
  and yet in how short a 
  time it comes to nothing itself
  while sometimes war
  other times 
  pestilence
  sweeps off many thousands of them together
  
   
  but let me be most foolish myself
  and one whom democritus may not only 
  laugh at but flout
  if i go one foot further in the discovery of the 
  follies and madnesses of the common people
  i ll betake me to them that 
  carry the reputation of wise men and hunt after that golden bough
  as 
  says the proverb
  among whom the grammarians hold the first place
  a 
  generation of men than whom nothing would be more miserable
  nothing more 
  perplexed
  nothing more hated of the gods
  did not i allay the troubles 
  of that pitiful profession with a certain kind of pleasant madness
  for 
  they are not only subject to those five curses with which home begins his 
  iliads
  as says the greek epigram
  but six hundred
  as being ever 
  hunger starved and slovens in their schools  schools
  did i say
  nay
  
  rather cloisters
  bridewells
  or slaughterhouses  grown old among a 
  company of boys
  deaf with their noise
  and pined away with stench and 
  nastiness
  and yet by my courtesy it is that they think themselves the 
  most excellent of all men
  so greatly do they please themselves in 
  frighting a company of fearful boys with a thundering voice and big looks
  
  tormenting them with ferules
  rods
  and whips
  and
  laying about them 
  without fear or wit
  imitate the ass in the lion s skin
  in the meantime 
  all that nastiness seems absolute spruceness
  that stench a perfume
  and 
  that miserable slavery a kingdom
  and such too as they would not change 
  their tyranny for phalaris  or dionysius  empire
  nor are they less happy 
  in that new opinion they have taken up of being learned
  for whereas most 
  of them beat into boys  heads nothing but foolish toys
  yet
  you good 
  gods
  what palemon
  what donatus
  do they not scorn in comparison of 
  themselves
  and so
  i know not by what tricks
  they bring it about that 
  to their boys  foolish mothers and dolt headed fathers they pass for such 
  as they fancy themselves
  add to this that other pleasure of theirs
  that 
  if any of them happen to find out who was anchises  mother
  or pick out 
  of some worm eaten manuscript a word not commonly known  as suppose it 
  bubsequa for a cowherd
  bovinator for a wrangler
  manticulator for a 
  cutpurse  or dig up the ruins of some ancient monument with the letters 
  half eaten out
  o jupiter
  what towerings
  what triumphs
  what 
  commendations
  as if they had conquered africa or taken in babylon
  
   
  but what of this when they give up and down their foolish insipid verses
  
  and there wants not others that admire them as much
  they believe 
  presently that virgil s soul is transmigrated into them
  but nothing like 
  this
  when with mutual compliments they praise
  admire
  and claw one 
  another
  whereas if another do but slip a word and one more quick sighted 
  than the rest discover it by accident
  o hercules
  what uproars
  what 
  bickerings
  what taunts
  what invectives
  if i lie
  let me have the ill 
  will of all the grammarians
  i knew in my time one of many arts
  a 
  grecian
  a latinist
  a mathematician
  a philosopher
  a physician
  a man 
  master of them all
  and sixty years of age
  who
  laying by all the rest
  
  perplexed and tormented himself for above twenty years in the study of 
  grammar
  fully reckoning himself a prince if he might but live so long 
  till he could certainly determine how the eight parts of speech were to 
  be distinguished
  which none of the greeks or latins had yet fully 
  cleared
  as if it were a matter to be decided by the sword if a man made 
  an adverb of a conjunction
  and for this cause is it that we have as many 
  grammars as grammarians
  nay more
  forasmuch as my friend aldus has given 
  us above five
  not passing by any kind of grammar
  how barbarously or 
  tediously soever compiled
  which he has not turned over and examined
  
  envying every man s attempts in this kind
  how to be pitied than happy
  
  as persons that are ever tormenting themselves
  adding
  changing
  putting 
  in
  blotting out
  revising
  reprinting
  showing it to friends
  and nine 
  years in correcting
  yet never fully satisfied
  at so great a rate do 
  they purchase this vain reward
  to wit
  praise
  and that too of a very 
  few
  with so many watchings
  so much sweat
  so much vexation and loss of 
  sleep
  the most precious of all things
  add to this the waste of health
  
  spoil of complexion
  weakness of eyes or rather blindness
  poverty
  envy
  
  abstinence from pleasure
  over hasty old age
  untimely death
  and the 
  like
  so highly does this wise man value the approbation of one or two 
  blear eyed fellows
  but how much happier is this my writer s dotage who 
  never studies for anything but puts in writing whatever he pleases or 
  what comes first in his head
  though it be but his dreams
  and all this 
  with small waste of paper
  as well knowing that the vainer those trifles 
  are
  the higher esteem they will have with the greater number
  that is to 
  say all the fools and unlearned
  and what matter is it to slight those 
  few learned if yet they ever read them
  or of what authority will the 
  censure of so few wise men be against so great a cloud of gainsayers
  
   
  but they are the wiser that put out other men s works for their own
  and 
  transfer that glory which others with great pains have obtained to 
  themselves
  relying on this
  that they conceive
  though it should so 
  happen that their theft be never so plainly detected
  that yet they 
  should enjoy the pleasure of it for the present
  and  tis worth one s 
  while to consider how they please themselves when they are applauded by 
  the common people
  pointed at in a crowd
  
 this is that excellent 
  person
 
  lie on booksellers  stalls
  and in the top of every page have 
  three hard words read
  but chiefly exotic and next degree to conjuring
  
  which
  by the immortal gods
  what are they but mere words
  and again
  if 
  you consider the world
  by how few understood
  and praised by fewer
  for 
  even among the unlearned there are different palates
  or what is it that 
  their own very names are often counterfeit or borrowed from some books of 
  the ancients
  when one styles himself telemachus
  another sthenelus
  a 
  third laertes
  a fourth polycrates
  a fifth thrasymachus
  so that there 
  is no difference whether they title their books with the 
 tale of a tub
 
  
  or
  according to the philosophers
  by alpha
  beta
  
   
  but the most pleasant of all is to see them praise one another with 
  reciprocal epistles
  verses
  and encomiums
  fools their fellow fools
  and 
  dunces their brother dunces
  this
  in the other s opinion
  is an absolute 
  alcaeus
  and the other
  in his
  a very callimachus
  he looks upon tully 
  as nothing to the other
  and the other again pronounces him more learned 
  than plato
  and sometimes too they pick out their antagonist and think to 
  raise themselves a fame by writing one against the other
  while the giddy 
  multitude are so long divided to whether of the two they shall determine 
  the victory
  till each goes off conqueror
  and
  as if he had done some 
  great action
  fancies himself a triumph
  and now wise men laugh at these 
  things as foolish
  as indeed they are
  who denies it
  yet in the 
  meantime
  such is my kindness to them
  they live a merry life and would 
  not change their imaginary triumphs
  no
  not with the scipioes
  while yet 
  those learned men
  though they laugh their fill and reap the benefit of 
  the other s folly
  cannot without ingratitude deny but that even they too 
  are not a little beholding to me themselves
  
   
  and among them our advocates challenge the first place
  nor is there any 
  sort of people that please themselves like them
  for while they daily 
  roll sisyphus his stone
  and quote you a thousand cases
  as it were
  in a 
  breath no matter how little to the purpose
  and heap glosses upon 
  glosses
  and opinions on the neck of opinions
  they bring it at last to 
  this pass
  that that study of all other seems the most difficult
  add to 
  these our logicians and sophists
  a generation of men more prattling than 
  an echo and the worst of them able to outchat a hundred of the best 
  picked gossips
  and yet their condition would be much better were they 
  only full of words and not so given to scolding that they most 
  obstinately hack and hew one another about a matter of nothing and make 
  such a sputter about terms and words till they have quite lost the sense
  
  and yet they are so happy in the good opinion of themselves that as soon 
  as they are furnished with two or three syllogisms
  they dare boldly 
  enter the lists against any man upon any point
  as not doubting but to 
  run him down with noise
  though the opponent were another stentor
  
   
  and next these come our philosophers
  so much reverenced for their furred 
  gowns and starched beards that they look upon themselves as the only wise 
  men and all others as shadows
  and yet how pleasantly do they dote while 
  they frame in their heads innumerable worlds
  measure out the sun
  the 
  moon
  the stars
  nay and heaven itself
  as it were
  with a pair of 
  compasses
  lay down the causes of lightning
  winds
  eclipses
  and other 
  the like inexplicable matters
  and all this too without the least 
  doubting
  as if they were nature s secretaries
  or dropped down among us 
  from the council of the gods
  while in the meantime nature laughs at them 
  and all their blind conjectures
  for that they know nothing
  even this is 
  a sufficient argument
  that they don t agree among themselves and so are 
  incomprehensible touching every particular
  these
  though they have not 
  the least degree of knowledge
  profess yet that they have mastered all
  
  nay
  though they neither know themselves
  nor perceive a ditch or block 
  that lies in their way
  for that perhaps most of them are half blind
  or 
  their wits a wool gathering
  yet give out that they have discovered 
  ideas
  universalities
  separated forms
  first matters
  quiddities
  
  haecceities
  formalities
  and the like stuff
  things so thin and bodiless 
  that i believe even lynceus himself was not able to perceive them
  but 
  then chiefly do they disdain the unhallowed crowd as often as with their 
  triangles
  quadrangles
  circles
  and the like mathematical devices
  more 
  confounded than a labyrinth
  and letters disposed one against the other
  
  as it were in battle array
  they cast a mist before the eyes of the 
  ignorant
  nor is there wanting of this kind some that pretend to 
  foretell things by the stars and make promises of miracles beyond 
  all things of soothsaying
  and are so fortunate as to meet with people 
  that believe them
  
   
  but perhaps i had better pass over our divines in silence and not stir 
  this pool or touch this fair but unsavory plant
  as a kind of men that 
  are supercilious beyond comparison
  and to that too
  implacable
  lest 
  setting them about my ears
  they attack me by troops and force me to a 
  recantation sermon
  which if i refuse
  they straight pronounce me a 
  heretic
  for this is the thunderbolt with which they fright those whom 
  they are resolved not to favor
  and truly
  though there are few others 
  that less willingly acknowledge the kindnesses i have done them
  yet even 
  these too stand fast bound to me upon no ordinary accounts
  while being 
  happy in their own opinion
  and as if they dwelt in the third heaven
  
  they look with haughtiness on all others as poor creeping things and 
  could almost find in their hearts to pity them
  while hedged in with so 
  many magisterial definitions
  conclusions
  corollaries
  propositions 
  explicit and implicit
  they abound with so many starting holes that 
  vulcan s net cannot hold them so fast
  but they ll slip through with 
  their distinctions
  with which they so easily cut all knots asunder that 
  a hatchet could not have done it better
  so plentiful are they in their 
  new found words and prodigious terms
  besides
  while they explicate the 
  most hidden mysteries according to their own fancy  as how the world was 
  first made
  how original sin is derived to posterity
  in what manner
  how 
  much room
  and how long time christ lay in the virgin s womb
  how 
  accidents subsist in the eucharist without their subject
  
   
  but these are common and threadbare
  these are worthy of our great and 
  illuminated divines
  as the world calls them
  at these
  if ever they fall 
  athwart them
  they prick up  as whether there was any instant of time in 
  the generation of the second person
  whether there be more than one 
  filiation in christ
  whether it be a possible proposition that god the 
  father hates the son
  or whether it was possible that christ could have 
  taken upon him the likeness of a woman
  or of the devil
  or of an ass
  or 
  of a stone
  or of a gourd
  and then how that gourd should have preached
  
  wrought miracles
  or been hung on the cross
  and what peter had 
  consecrated if he had administered the sacrament at what time the body of 
  christ hung upon the cross
  or whether at the same time he might be said 
  to be man
  whether after the resurrection there will be any eating and 
  drinking
  since we are so much afraid of hunger and thirst in this world
  
  there are infinite of these subtle trifles
  and others more subtle than 
  these
  of notions
  relations
  instants
  formalities
  quiddities
  
  haecceities
  which no one can perceive without a lynceus whose eyes could 
  look through a stone wall and discover those things through the thickest 
  darkness that never were
  
   
  add to this those their other determinations
  and those too so contrary 
  to common opinion that those oracles of the stoics
  which they call 
  paradoxes
  seem in comparison of these but blockish and idle  as  tis a 
  lesser crime to kill a thousand men than to set a stitch on a poor man s 
  shoe on the sabbath day
  and that a man should rather choose that the 
  whole world with all food and raiment
  as they say
  should perish
  than 
  tell a lie
  though never so inconsiderable
  and these most subtle 
  subtleties are rendered yet more subtle by the several methods of so many 
  schoolmen
  that one might sooner wind himself out of a labyrinth than the 
  entanglements of the realists
  nominalists
  thomists
  albertists
  
  occamists
  scotists
  nor have i named all the several sects
  but only 
  some of the chief
  in all which there is so much doctrine and so much 
  difficulty that i may well conceive the apostles
  had they been to deal 
  with these new kind of divines
  had needed to have prayed in aid of some 
  other spirit
  
   
  paul knew what faith was
  and yet when he said
  
 faith is the substance 
  of things hoped for
  and the evidence of things not seen
 
  he did not 
  define it doctor like
  and as he understood charity well himself
  so he 
  did as illogically divide and define it to others in his first epistle to 
  the corinthians
  chapter the thirteenth
  and devoutly
  no doubt
  did the 
  apostles consecrate the eucharist
  yet
  had they been asked the question 
  touching the 
 terminus a quo
  and the 
 terminus ad quem
  of 
  transubstantiation
  of the manner how the same body can be in several 
  places at one and the same time
  of the difference the body of christ has 
  in heaven from that of the cross
  or this in the sacrament
  in what point 
  of time transubstantiation is
  whereas prayer
  by means of which it is
  
  as being a discrete quantity
  is transient
  they would not
  i conceive
  
  have answered with the same subtlety as the scotists dispute and define 
  it
  they knew the mother of jesus
  but which of them has so 
  philosophically demonstrated how she was preserved from original sin as 
  have done our divines
  peter received the keys
  and from him too that 
  would not have trusted them with a person unworthy
  yet whether he had 
  understanding or no
  i know not
  for certainly he never attained to that 
  subtlety to determine how he could have the key of knowledge that had no 
  knowledge himself
  they baptized far and near
  and yet taught nowhere 
  what was the formal
  material
  efficient
  and final cause of baptism
  nor 
  made the least mention of delible and indelible characters
  they 
  worshiped
   tis true
  but in spirit
  following herein no other than that 
  of the gospel
  
 god is a spirit
  and they that worship
  must worship him 
  in spirit and truth
 
  yet it does not appear it was at that time revealed 
  to them that an image sketched on the wall with a coal was to be 
  worshiped with the same worship as christ himself
  if at least the two 
  forefingers be stretched out
  the hair long and uncut
  and have three 
  rays about the crown of the head
  for who can conceive these things
  
  unless he has spent at least six and thirty years in the philosophical 
  and supercelestial whims of aristotle and the schoolmen
  
   
  in like manner
  the apostles press to us grace
  but which of them 
  distinguishes between free grace and grace that makes a man acceptable
  
  they exhort us to good works
  and yet determine not what is the work 
  working
  and what a resting in the work done
  they incite us to charity
  
  and yet make no difference between charity infused and charity wrought in 
  us by our own endeavors
  nor do they declare whether it be an accident or 
  a substance
  a thing created or uncreated
  they detest and abominate sin
  
  but let me not live if they could define according to art what that is 
  which we call sin
  unless perhaps they were inspired by the spirit of the 
  scotists
  nor can i be brought to believe that paul
  by whose learning 
  you may judge the rest
  would have so often condemned questions
  
  disputes
  genealogies
  and
  as himself calls them
  
 strifes of words
 
  if 
  he had thoroughly understood those subtleties
  especially when all the 
  debates and controversies of those times were rude and blockish in 
  comparison of the more than chrysippean subtleties of our masters
  
  although yet the gentlemen are so modest that if they meet with anything 
  written by the apostles not so smooth and even as might be expected from 
  a master
  they do not presently condemn it but handsomely bend it to 
  their own purpose
  so great respect and honor do they give
  partly to 
  antiquity and partly to the name of apostle
  and truly  twas a kind of 
  injustice to require so great things of them that never heard the least 
  word from their masters concerning it
  and so if the like happen in 
  chrysostom
  basil
  jerome
  they think it enough to say they are not 
  obliged by it
  
   
  the apostles also confuted the heathen philosophers and jews
  a people 
  than whom none more obstinate
  but rather by their good lives and 
  miracles than syllogisms
  and yet there was scarce one among them that 
  was capable of understanding the least 
 quodlibet
  of the scotists
  but 
  now
  where is that heathen or heretic that must not presently stoop to 
  such wire drawn subtleties
  unless he be so thick skulled that he can t 
  apprehend them
  or so impudent as to hiss them down
  or
  being furnished 
  with the same tricks
  be able to make his party good with them
  as if a 
  man should set a conjurer on work against a conjurer
  or fight with one 
  hallowed sword against another
  which would prove no other than a work to 
  no purpose
  for my own part i conceive the christians would do much 
  better if instead of those dull troops and companies of soldiers with 
  which they have managed their war with such doubtful success
  they would 
  send the bawling scotists
  the most obstinate occamists
  and invincible 
  albertists to war against the turks and saracens
  and they would see
  i 
  guess
  a most pleasant combat and such a victory as was never before
  for 
  who is so faint whom their devices will not enliven
  who so stupid whom 
  such spurs can t quicken
  or who so quick sighted before whose eyes they 
  can t cast a mist
  
   
  but you ll say
  i jest
  nor are you without cause
  since even among 
  divines themselves there are some that have learned better and are ready 
  to turn their stomachs at those foolish subtleties of the others
  there 
  are some that detest them as a kind of sacrilege and count it the height 
  of impiety to speak so irreverently of such hidden things
  rather to be 
  adored than explicated
  to dispute of them with such profane and 
  heathenish niceties
  to define them so arrogantly and pollute the majesty 
  of divinity with such pithless and sordid terms and opinions
  meantime 
  the others please
  nay hug themselves in their happiness
  and are so 
  taken up with these pleasant trifles that they have not so much leisure 
  as to cast the least eye on the gospel or st
  paul s epistles
  and while 
  they play the fool at this rate in their schools
  they make account the 
  universal church would otherwise perish
  unless
  as the poets fancied of 
  atlas that he supported heaven with his shoulders
  they underpropped the 
  other with their syllogistical buttresses
  and how great a happiness is 
  this
  think you
  while
  as if holy writ were a nose of wax
  they fashion 
  and refashion it according to their pleasure
  while they require that 
  their own conclusions
  subscribed by two or three schoolmen
  be accounted 
  greater than solon s laws and preferred before the papal decretals
  
  while
  as censors of the world
  they force everyone to a recantation that 
  differs but a hair s breadth from the least of their explicit or implicit 
  determinations
  and those too they pronounce like oracles
  this 
  proposition is scandalous
  this irreverent
  this has a smack of heresy
  
  this no very good sound
  so that neither baptism
  nor the gospel
  nor 
  paul
  nor peter
  nor st
  jerome
  nor st
  augustine
  no nor most 
  aristotelian thomas himself can make a man a christian
  without these 
  bachelors too be pleased to give him his grace
  and the like in their 
  subtlety in judging
  for who would think he were no christian that should 
  say these two speeches 
 matula putes
  and 
 matula putet
 
  or 
 ollae 
  fervere
  and 
 ollam fervere
  were not both good latin
  unless their 
  wisdoms had taught us the contrary
  who had delivered the church from 
  such mists of error
  which yet no one ever met with
  had they not come 
  out with some university seal for it
  and are they not most happy while 
  they do these things
  
   
  then for what concerns hell
  how exactly they describe everything
  as if 
  they had been conversant in that commonwealth most part of their time
  
  again
  how do they frame in their fancy new orbs
  adding to those we have 
  already an eighth
  a goodly one
  no doubt
  and spacious enough
  lest 
  perhaps their happy souls might lack room to walk in
  entertain their 
  friends
  and now and then play at football
  and with these and a thousand 
  the like fopperies their heads are so full stuffed and stretched that i 
  believe jupiter s brain was not near so big when
  being in labor with 
  pallas
  he was beholding to the midwifery of vulcan s axe
  and therefore 
  you must not wonder if in their public disputes they are so bound about 
  the head
  lest otherwise perhaps their brains might leap out
  nay
  i have 
  sometimes laughed myself to see them so tower in their own opinion when 
  they speak most barbarously
  and when they humh and hawh so pitifully 
  that none but one of their own tribe can understand them
  they call it 
  heights which the vulgar can t reach
  for they say  tis beneath the 
  dignity of divine mysteries to be cramped and tied up to the narrow rules 
  of grammarians
  from whence we may conjecture the great prerogative of 
  divines
  if they only have the privilege of speaking corruptly
  in which 
  yet every cobbler thinks himself concerned for his share
  lastly
  they 
  look upon themselves as somewhat more than men as often as they are 
  devoutly saluted by the name of 
 our masters
 
  in which they fancy there 
  lies as much as in the jews  
 jehovah
 
  and therefore they reckon it a 
  crime if 
 magister noster
  be written other than in capital letters
  and 
  if anyone should preposterously say 
 noster magister
 
  he has at once 
  overturned the whole body of divinity
  
   
  and next these come those that commonly call themselves the religious and 
  monks
  most false in both titles
  when both a great part of them are 
  farthest from religion
  and no men swarm thicker in all places than 
  themselves
  nor can i think of anything that could be more miserable did 
  not i support them so many several ways
  for whereas all men detest them 
  to that height
  that they take it for ill luck to meet one of them by 
  chance
  yet such is their happiness that they flatter themselves
  for 
  first
  they reckon it one of the main points of piety if they are so 
  illiterate that they can t so much as read
  and then when they run over 
  their offices
  which they carry about them
  rather by tale than 
  understanding
  they believe the gods more than ordinarily pleased with 
  their braying
  and some there are among them that put off their 
  trumperies at vast rates
  yet rove up and down for the bread they eat
  
  nay
  there is scarce an inn
  wagon
  or ship into which they intrude not
  
  to the no small damage of the commonwealth of beggars
  and yet
  like 
  pleasant fellows
  with all this vileness
  ignorance
  rudeness
  and 
  impudence
  they represent to us
  for so they call it
  the lives of the 
  apostles
  yet what is more pleasant than that they do all things by rule 
  and
  as it were
  a kind of mathematics
  the least swerving from which 
  were a crime beyond forgiveness  as how many knots their shoes must be 
  tied with
  of what color everything is
  what distinction of habits
  of 
  what stuff made
  how many straws broad their girdles and of what fashion
  
  how many bushels wide their cowl
  how many fingers long their hair
  and 
  how many hours sleep
  which exact equality
  how disproportionate it is
  
  among such variety of bodies and tempers
  who is there that does not 
  perceive it
  and yet by reason of these fooleries they not only set 
  slight by others
  but each different order
  men otherwise professing 
  apostolical charity
  despise one another
  and for the different wearing 
  of a habit
  or that  tis of darker color
  they put all things in 
  combustion
  and among these there are some so rigidly religious that 
  their upper garment is haircloth
  their inner of the finest linen
  and
  
  on the contrary
  others wear linen without and hair next their skins
  
  others
  again
  are as afraid to touch money as poison
  and yet neither 
  forbear wine nor dallying with women
  in a word
   tis their only care 
  that none of them come near one another in their manner of living
  nor 
  do they endeavor how they may be like christ
  but how they may differ 
  among themselves
  
   
  and another great happiness they conceive in their names
  while they call 
  themselves cordiliers
  and among these too
  some are colletes
  some 
  minors
  some minims
  some crossed
  and again
  these are benedictines
  
  those bernardines
  these carmelites
  those augustines
  these williamites
  
  and those jacobines
  as if it were not worth the while to be called 
  christians
  and of these
  a great part build so much on their ceremonies 
  and petty traditions of men that they think one heaven is too poor a 
  reward for so great merit
  little dreaming that the time will come when 
  christ
  not regarding any of these trifles
  will call them to account for 
  his precept of charity
  one shall show you a large trough full of all 
  kinds of fish
  another tumble you out so many bushels of prayers
  another 
  reckon you so many myriads of fasts
  and fetch them up again in one 
  dinner by eating till he cracks again
  another produces more bundles of 
  ceremonies than seven of the stoutest ships would be able to carry
  
  another brags he has not touched a penny these three score years without 
  two pair of gloves at least upon his hands
  another wears a cowl so lined 
  with grease that the poorest tarpaulin would not stoop to take it up
  
  another will tell you he has lived these fifty five years like a sponge
  
  continually fastened to the same place
  another is grown hoarse with his 
  daily chanting
  another has contracted a lethargy by his solitary living
  
  and another the palsy in his tongue for want of speaking
  but christ
  
  interrupting them in their vanities
  which otherwise were endless
  will 
  ask them
  
 whence this new kind of jews
  i acknowledge one commandment
  
  which is truly mine
  of which alone i hear nothing
  i promised
   tis 
  true
  my father s heritage
  and that without parables
  not to cowls
  odd 
  prayers
  and fastings
  but to the duties of faith and charity
  nor can i 
  acknowledge them that least acknowledge their faults
  they that would 
  seem holier than myself
  let them if they like possess to themselves 
  those three hundred sixty five heavens of basilides the heretic s 
  invention
  or command them whose foolish traditions they have preferred 
  before my precepts to erect them a new one
 
  when they shall hear these 
  things and see common ordinary persons preferred before them
  with what 
  countenance
  think you
  will they behold one another
  in the meantime 
  they are happy in their hopes
  and for this also they are beholding 
  to me
  
   
  and yet these kind of people
  though they are as it were of another 
  commonwealth
  no man dares despise
  especially those begging friars
  
  because they are privy to all men s secrets by means of confessions
  as 
  they call them
  which yet were no less than treason to discover
  unless
  
  being got drunk
  they have a mind to be pleasant
  and then all comes out
  
  that is to say by hints and conjectures but suppressing the names
  but if 
  anyone should anger these wasps
  they ll sufficiently revenge themselves 
  in their public sermons and so point out their enemy by circumlocutions 
  that there s no one but understands whom  tis they mean
  unless he 
  understand nothing at all
  nor will they give over their barking till you 
  throw the dogs a bone
  and now tell me
  what juggler or mountebank you 
  had rather behold than hear them rhetorically play the fool in their 
  preachments
  and yet most sweetly imitating what rhetoricians have 
  written touching the art of good speaking
  good god
  what several 
  postures they have
  how they shift their voice
  sing out their words
  
  skip up and down
  and are ever and anon making such new faces that they 
  confound all things with noise
  and yet this knack of theirs is no less a 
  mystery that runs in succession from one brother to another
  which though 
  it be not lawful for me to know
  however i ll venture at it by 
  conjectures
  and first they invoke whatever they have scraped from the 
  poets
  and in the next place
  if they are to discourse of charity
  they 
  take their rise from the river nilus
  or to set out the mystery of the 
  cross
  from bell and the dragon
  or to dispute of fasting
  from the 
  twelve signs of the zodiac
  or
  being to preach of faith
  ground their 
  matter on the square of a circle
  
   
  i have heard myself one
  and he no small fool  i was mistaken
  i would 
  have said scholar  that being in a famous assembly explaining the mystery 
  of the trinity
  that he might both let them see his learning was not 
  ordinary and withal satisfy some theological ears
  he took a new way
  to 
  wit from the letters
  syllables
  and the word itself
  then from the 
  coherence of the nominative case and the verb
  and the adjective and 
  substantive
  and while most of the audience wondered
  and some of them 
  muttered that of horace
  
 what does all this trumpery drive at
 
  at last 
  he brought the matter to this head
  that he would demonstrate that the 
  mystery of the trinity was so clearly expressed in the very rudiments of 
  grammar that the best mathematician could not chalk it out more plainly
  
  and in this discourse did this most superlative theologian beat his 
  brains for eight whole months that at this hour he s as blind as a 
  beetle
  to wit
  all the sight of his eyes being run into the sharpness of 
  his wit
  but for all that he thinks nothing of his blindness
  rather 
  taking the same for too cheap a price of such a glory as he won thereby
  
   
  and besides him i met with another
  some eighty years of age
  and such a 
  divine that you d have sworn scotus himself was revived in him
  he
  being 
  upon the point of unfolding the mystery of the name jesus
  did with 
  wonderful subtlety demonstrate that there lay hidden in those letters 
  whatever could be said of him
  for that it was only declined with three 
  cases
  he said
  it was a manifest token of the divine trinity
  and then
  
  that the first ended in  s 
  the second in  m 
  the third in  u 
  there 
  was in it an ineffable mystery
  to wit
  those three letters declaring to 
  us that he was the beginning
  middle
  and end   summum
  medium
  et 
  ultimum   of all
  nay
  the mystery was yet more abstruse
  for he so 
  mathematically split the word jesus into two equal parts that he left the 
  middle letter by itself
  and then told us that that letter in hebrew was 
   schin  or  sin 
  and that  sin  in the scotch tongue
  as he remembered
  
  signified as much as sin
  from whence he gathered that it was jesus that 
  took away the sins of the world
  at which new exposition the audience 
  were so wonderfully intent and struck with admiration
  especially the 
  theologians
  that there wanted little but that niobe like they had been 
  turned to stones
  whereas the like had almost happened to me
  as befell 
  the priapus in horace
  and not without cause
  for when were the grecian 
  demosthenes or roman cicero ever guilty of the like
  they thought that 
  introduction faulty that was wide of the matter
  as if it were not the 
  way of carters and swineherds that have no more wit than god sent them
  
  but these learned men think their preamble
  for so they call it
  then 
  chiefly rhetorical when it has least coherence with the rest of the 
  argument
  that the admiring audience may in the meanwhile whisper to 
  themselves
  
 what will he be at now
 
  in the third place
  they bring in 
  instead of narration some texts of scripture
  but handle them cursorily
  
  and as it were by the bye
  when yet it is the only thing they should have 
  insisted on
  and fourthly
  as it were changing a part in the play
  they 
  bolt out with some question in divinity
  and many times relating neither 
  to earth nor heaven
  and this they look upon as a piece of art
  here they 
  erect their theological crests and beat into the people s ears those 
  magnificent titles of illustrious doctors
  subtle doctors
  most subtle 
  doctors
  seraphic doctors
  cherubin doctors
  holy doctors
  unquestionable 
  doctors
  and the like
  and then throw abroad among the ignorant people 
  syllogisms
  majors
  minors
  conclusions
  corollaries
  suppositions
  and 
  those so weak and foolish that they are below pedantry
  there remains yet 
  the fifth act in which one would think they should show their mastery
  
  and here they bring in some foolish insipid fable out of  speculum 
  historiale  or  gesta romanorum  and expound it allegorically
  
  tropologically
  and anagogically
  and after this manner do they and their 
  chimera
  and such as horace despaired of compassing when he wrote 
 humano 
  capiti
 
  etc
  
   
  but they have heard from somebody
  i know not whom
  that the beginning of 
  a speech should be sober and grave and least given to noise
  and 
  therefore they begin theirs at that rate they can scarce hear themselves
  
  as if it were not matter whether anyone understood them
  they have 
  learned somewhere that to move the affections a louder voice is 
  requisite
  whereupon they that otherwise would speak like a mouse in a 
  cheese start out of a sudden into a downright fury
  even there too
  where 
  there s the least need of it
  a man would swear they were past the power 
  of hellebore
  so little do they consider where  tis they run out
  again
  
  because they have heard that as a speech comes up to something
  a man 
  should press it more earnestly
  they
  however they begin
  use a strange 
  contention of voice in every part
  though the matter itself be never so 
  flat
  and end in that manner as if they d run themselves out of breath
  
  lastly
  they have learned that among rhetoricians there is some mention 
  of laughter
  and therefore they study to prick in a jest here and there
  
  but
  o venus
  so void of wit and so little to the purpose that it may be 
  truly called an ass s playing on the harp
  and sometimes also they use 
  somewhat of a sting
  but so nevertheless that they rather tickle than 
  wound
  nor do they ever more truly flatter than when they would seem to 
  use the greatest freedom of speech
  lastly
  such is their whole action 
  that a man would swear they had learned it from our common tumblers
  
  though yet they come short of them in every respect
  however
  they are 
  both so like that no man will dispute but that either these learned their 
  rhetoric from them
  or they theirs from these
  and yet they light on some 
  that
  when they hear them
  conceive they hear very demosthenes and 
  ciceroes
  of which sort chiefly are our merchants and women
  whose ears 
  only they endeavor to please
  because as to the first
  if they stroke 
  them handsomely
  some part or other of their ill gotten goods is wont to 
  fall to their share
  and the women
  though for many other things they 
  favor this order
  this is not the least
  that they commit to their 
  breasts whatever discontents they have against their husbands
  and now
  i 
  conceive me
  you see how much this kind of people are beholding to me
  
  that with their petty ceremonies
  ridiculous trifles
  and noise exercise 
  a kind of tyranny among mankind
  believing themselves very pauls and 
  anthonies
  
   
  but i willingly give over these stage players that are such ingrateful 
  dissemblers of the courtesies i have done them and such impudent 
  pretenders to religion which they haven t
  and now i have a mind to give 
  some small touches of princes and courts
  of whom i am had in reverence
  
  aboveboard and
  as it becomes gentlemen
  frankly
  and truly
  if they had 
  the least proportion of sound judgment
  what life were more unpleasant 
  than theirs
  or so much to be avoided
  for whoever did but truly weigh 
  with himself how great a burden lies upon his shoulders that would truly 
  discharge the duty of a prince
  he would not think it worth his while to 
  make his way to a crown by perjury and parricide
  he would consider that 
  he that takes a scepter in his hand should manage the public
  not his 
  private
  interest
  study nothing but the common good
  and not in the 
  least go contrary to those laws whereof himself is both the author and 
  exactor
  that he is to take an account of the good or evil administration 
  of all his magistrates and subordinate officers
  that
  though he is but 
  one
  all men s eyes are upon him
  and in his power it is
  either like a 
  good planet to give life and safety to mankind by his harmless influence
  
  or like a fatal comet to send mischief and destruction
  that the vices of 
  other men are not alike felt
  nor so generally communicated
  and that a 
  prince stands in that place that his least deviation from the rule of 
  honesty and honor reaches farther than himself and opens a gap to many 
  men s ruin
  besides
  that the fortune of princes has many things 
  attending it that are but too apt to train them out of the way
  as 
  pleasure
  liberty
  flattery
  excess
  for which cause he should the more 
  diligently endeavor and set a watch over himself
  lest perhaps he be led 
  aside and fail in his duty
  lastly
  to say nothing of treasons
  ill will
  
  and such other mischiefs he s in jeopardy of
  that that true king is over 
  his head
  who in a short time will call him to account for every the 
  least trespass
  and that so much the more severely by how much more 
  mighty was the empire committed to his charge
  these and the like if a 
  prince should duly weigh
  and weigh it he would if he were wise
  he would 
  neither be able to sleep nor take any hearty repast
  
   
  but now by my courtesy they leave all this care to the gods and are only 
  taken up with themselves
  not admitting anyone to their ear but such as 
  know how to speak pleasant things and not trouble them with business
  
  they believe they have discharged all the duty of a prince if they hunt 
  every day
  keep a stable of fine horses
  sell dignities and commanderies
  
  and invent new ways of draining the citizens  purses and bringing it into 
  their own exchequer
  but under such dainty new found names that though 
  the thing be most unjust in itself
  it carries yet some face of equity
  
  adding to this some little sweet nings that whatever happens
  they may be 
  secure of the common people
  and now suppose someone
  such as they 
  sometimes are
  a man ignorant of laws
  little less than an enemy to the 
  public good
  and minding nothing but his own
  given up to pleasure
  a 
  hater of learning
  liberty
  and justice
  studying nothing less than the 
  public safety
  but measuring everything by his own will and profit
  and 
  then put on him a golden chain that declares the accord of all virtues 
  linked one to another
  a crown set with diamonds
  that should put him in 
  mind how he ought to excel all others in heroic virtues
  besides a 
  scepter
  the emblem of justice and an untainted heart
  and lastly
  a 
  purple robe
  a badge of that charity he owes the commonwealth
  all which 
  if a prince should compare them with his own life
  he would
  i believe
  
  be clearly ashamed of his bravery
  and be afraid lest some or other 
  gibing expounder turn all this tragical furniture into a ridiculous 
  laughingstock
  
   
  and as to the court lords
  what should i mention them
  than most of whom 
  though there be nothing more indebted
  more servile
  more witless
  more 
  contemptible
  yet they would seem as they were the most excellent of all 
  others
  and yet in this only thing no men more modest
  in that they are 
  contented to wear about them gold
  jewels
  purple
  and those other marks 
  of virtue and wisdom
  but for the study of the things themselves
  they 
  remit it to others
  thinking it happiness enough for them that they can 
  call the king master
  have learned the cringe    la mode 
  know when and 
  where to use those titles of your grace
  my lord
  your magnificence
  in a 
  word that they are past all shame and can flatter pleasantly
  for these 
  are the arts that speak a man truly noble and an exact courtier
  but if 
  you look into their manner of life you ll find them mere sots
  as 
  debauched as penelope s wooers
  you know the other part of the verse
  
  which the echo will better tell you than i can
  they sleep till noon and 
  have their mercenary levite come to their bedside
  where he chops over 
  his matins before they are half up
  then to breakfast
  which is scarce 
  done but dinner stays for them
  from thence they go to dice
  tables
  
  cards
  or entertain themselves with jesters
  fools
  gambols
  and horse 
  tricks
  in the meantime they have one or two beverages
  and then supper
  
  and after that a banquet
  and  twere well
  by jupiter
  there were no more 
  than one
  and in this manner do their hours
  days
  months
  years
  age 
  slide away without the least irksomeness
  nay
  i have sometimes gone away 
  many inches fatter
  to see them speak big words
  while each of the ladies 
  believes herself so much nearer to the gods by how much the longer train 
  she trails after her
  while one nobleman edges out another
  that he may 
  get the nearer to jupiter himself
  and everyone of them pleases himself 
  the more by how much more massive is the chain he swags on his shoulders
  
  as if he meant to show his strength as well as his wealth
  
   
  nor are princes by themselves in their manner of life
  since popes
  
  cardinals
  and bishops have so diligently followed their steps that 
  they ve almost got the start of them
  for if any of them would consider 
  what their albe should put them in mind of
  to wit a blameless life
  what 
  is meant by their forked miters
  whose each point is held in by the same 
  knot
  we ll suppose it a perfect knowledge of the old and new testaments
  
  what those gloves on their hands
  but a sincere administration of the 
  sacraments
  and free from all touch of worldly business
  what their 
  crosier
  but a careful looking after the flock committed to their charge
  
  what the cross born before them
  but victory over all earthly 
  affections  these
  i say
  and many of the like kind should anyone truly 
  consider
  would he not live a sad and troublesome life
  whereas now they 
  do well enough while they feed themselves only
  and for the care of their 
  flock either put it over to christ or lay it all on their suffragans
  as 
  they call them
  or some poor vicars
  nor do they so much as remember 
  their name
  or what the word bishop signifies
  to wit
  labor
  care
  and 
  trouble
  but in racking to gather money they truly act the part of 
  bishops
  and herein acquit themselves to be no blind seers
  
   
  in like manner cardinals
  if they thought themselves the successors of 
  the apostles
  they would likewise imagine that the same things the other 
  did are required of them
  and that they are not lords but dispensers of 
  spiritual things of which they must shortly give an exact account
  but if 
  they also would a little philosophize on their habit and think with 
  themselves what s the meaning of their linen rochet
  is it not a 
  remarkable and singular integrity of life
  what that inner purple
  is it 
  not an earnest and fervent love of god
  or what that outward
  whose loose 
  plaits and long train fall round his reverence s mule and are large 
  enough to cover a camel
  is it not charity that spreads itself so wide to 
  the succor of all men
  that is
  to instruct
  exhort
  comfort
  reprehend
  
  admonish
  compose wars
  resist wicked princes
  and willingly expend not 
  only their wealth but their very lives for the flock of christ
  though 
  yet what need at all of wealth to them that supply the room of the poor 
  apostles
  these things
  i say
  did they but duly consider
  they would not 
  be so ambitious of that dignity
  or
  if they were
  they would willingly 
  leave it and live a laborious
  careful life
  such as was that of the 
  ancient apostles
  
   
  and for popes
  that supply the place of christ
  if they should endeavor 
  to imitate his life
  to wit his poverty
  labor
  doctrine
  cross
  and 
  contempt of life
  or should they consider what the name pope
  that is 
  father
  or holiness
  imports
  who would live more disconsolate than 
  themselves
  or who would purchase that chair with all his substance
  or 
  defend it
  so purchased
  with swords
  poisons
  and all force imaginable
  
  so great a profit would the access of wisdom deprive him of  wisdom did i 
  say
  nay
  the least corn of that salt which christ speaks of
  so much 
  wealth
  so much honor
  so much riches
  so many victories
  so many 
  offices
  so many dispensations
  so much tribute
  so many pardons
  such 
  horses
  such mules
  such guards
  and so much pleasure would it lose them
  
  you see how much i have comprehended in a little
  instead of which it 
  would bring in watchings
  fastings
  tears
  prayers
  sermons
  good 
  endeavors
  sighs
  and a thousand the like troublesome exercises
  nor is 
  this least considerable
  so many scribes
  so many copying clerks
  so many 
  notaries
  so many advocates
  so many promoters
  so many secretaries
  so 
  many muleteers
  so many grooms
  so many bankers
  in short
  that vast 
  multitude of men that overcharge the roman see  i mistook
  i meant 
  honor  might beg their bread
  
   
  a most inhuman and economical thing
  and more to be execrated
  that those 
  great princes of the church and true lights of the world should be 
  reduced to a staff and a wallet
  whereas now
  if there be anything that 
  requires their pains
  they leave that to peter and paul that have leisure 
  enough
  but if there be anything of honor or pleasure
  they take that to 
  themselves
  by which means it is
  yet by my courtesy
  that scarce any 
  kind of men live more voluptuously or with less trouble
  as believing 
  that christ will be well enough pleased if in their mystical and almost 
  mimical pontificality
  ceremonies
  titles of holiness and the like
  and 
  blessing and cursing
  they play the parts of bishops
  to work miracles is 
  old and antiquated
  and not in fashion now
  to instruct the people
  
  troublesome
  to interpret the scripture
  pedantic
  to pray
  a sign one 
  has little else to do
  to shed tears
  silly and womanish
  to be poor
  
  base
  to be vanquished
  dishonorable and little becoming him that scarce 
  admits even kings to kiss his slipper
  and lastly
  to die
  uncouth
  and 
  to be stretched on a cross
  infamous
  
   
  theirs are only those weapons and sweet blessings which paul mentions
  
  and of these truly they are bountiful enough
  as interdictions
  hangings
  
  heavy burdens
  reproofs
  anathemas
  executions in effigy
  and that 
  terrible thunderbolt of excommunication
  with the very sight of which 
  they sink men s souls beneath the bottom of hell
  which yet these most 
  holy fathers in christ and his vicars hurl with more fierceness against 
  none than against such as
  by the instigation of the devil
  attempt to 
  lessen or rob them of peter s patrimony
  when
  though those words in the 
  gospel
  
 we have left all
  and followed thee
 
  were his
  yet they call 
  his patrimony lands
  cities
  tribute
  imposts
  riches
  for which
  being 
  enflamed with the love of christ
  they contend with fire and sword
  and 
  not without loss of much christian blood
  and believe they have then most 
  apostolically defended the church
  the spouse of christ
  when the enemy
  
  as they call them
  are valiantly routed
  as if the church had any 
  deadlier enemies than wicked prelates
  who not only suffer christ to run 
  out of request for want of preaching him
  but hinder his spreading by 
  their multitudes of laws merely contrived for their own profit
  corrupt 
  him by their forced expositions
  and murder him by the evil example of 
  their pestilent life
  
   
  nay
  further
  whereas the church of christ was founded in blood
  
  confirmed by blood
  and augmented by blood
  now
  as if christ
  who after 
  his wonted manner defends his people
  were lost
  they govern all by the 
  sword
  and whereas war is so savage a thing that it rather befits beasts 
  than men
  so outrageous that the very poets feigned it came from the 
  furies
  so pestilent that it corrupts all men s manners
  so unjust that 
  it is best executed by the worst of men
  so wicked that it has no 
  agreement with christ
  and yet
  omitting all the other
  they make this 
  their only business
  here you ll see decrepit old fellows acting the 
  parts of young men
  neither troubled at their costs
  nor wearied with 
  their labors
  nor discouraged at anything
  so they may have the liberty 
  of turning laws
  religion
  peace
  and all things else quite topsy turvy
  
  nor are they destitute of their learned flatterers that call that 
  palpable madness zeal
  piety
  and valor
  having found out a new way by 
  which a man may kill his brother without the least breach of that charity 
  which
  by the command of christ
  one christian owes another
  and here
  in 
  troth
  i m a little at a stand whether the ecclesiastical german electors 
  gave them this example
  or rather took it from them
  who
  laying aside 
  their habit
  benedictions
  and all the like ceremonies
  so act the part 
  of commanders that they think it a mean thing
  and least beseeming a 
  bishop
  to show the least courage to godward unless it be in a battle
  
   
  and as to the common herd of priests
  they account it a crime to 
  degenerate from the sanctity of their prelates
  heidah
  how soldier like 
  they bustle about the  jus divinum  of titles
  and how quick sighted they 
  are to pick the least thing out of the writings of the ancients wherewith 
  they may fright the common people and convince them
  if possible
  that 
  more than a tenth is due
  yet in the meantime it least comes in their 
  heads how many things are everywhere extant concerning that duty which 
  they owe the people
  nor does their shorn crown in the least admonish 
  them that a priest should be free from all worldly desires and think of 
  nothing but heavenly things
  whereas on the contrary
  these jolly fellows 
  say they have sufficiently discharged their offices if they but anyhow 
  mumble over a few odd prayers
  which
  so help me
  hercules
  i wonder if 
  any god either hear or understand
  since they do neither themselves
  
  especially when they thunder them out in that manner they are wont
  but 
  this they have in common with those of the heathens
  that they are 
  vigilant enough to the harvest of their profit
  nor is there any of them 
  that is not better read in those laws than the scripture
  whereas if 
  there be anything burdensome
  they prudently lay that on other men s 
  shoulders and shift it from one to the other
  as men toss a ball from 
  hand to hand
  following herein the example of lay princes who commit the 
  government of their kingdoms to their grand ministers
  and they again to 
  others
  and leave all study of piety to the common people
  in like manner 
  the common people put it over to those they call ecclesiastics
  as if 
  themselves were no part of the church
  or that their vow in baptism had 
  lost its obligation
  again
  the priests that call themselves secular
  as 
  if they were initiated to the world
  not to christ
  lay the burden on the 
  regulars
  the regulars on the monks
  the monks that have more liberty on 
  those that have less
  and all of them on the mendicants
  the mendicants 
  on the carthusians
  among whom
  if anywhere
  this piety lies buried
  but 
  yet so close that scarce anyone can perceive it
  in like manner the 
  popes
  the most diligent of all others in gathering in the harvest of 
  money
  refer all their apostolical work to the bishops
  the bishops to 
  the parsons
  the parsons to the vicars
  the vicars to their brother 
  mendicants
  and they again throw back the care of the flock on those that 
  take the wool
  
   
  but it is not my business to sift too narrowly the lives of prelates and 
  priests for fear i seem to have intended rather a satire than an oration
  
  and be thought to tax good princes while i praise the bad
  and therefore
  
  what i slightly taught before has been to no other end but that it might 
  appear that there s no man can live pleasantly unless he be initiated to 
  my rites and have me propitious to him
  for how can it be otherwise when 
  fortune
  the great directress of all human affairs
  and myself are so all 
  one that she was always an enemy to those wise men
  and on the contrary 
  so favorable to fools and careless fellows that all things hit luckily 
  to them
  
   
  you have heard of that timotheus
  the most fortunate general of the 
  athenians
  of whom came that proverb
  
 his net caught fish
  though he 
  were asleep
 
  and that 
 the owl flies
 
  whereas these others hit 
  properly
  wise men 
 born in the fourth month
 
  and again
  
 he rides 
  sejanus s his horse
 
  and 
 gold of toulouse
 
  signifying thereby the 
  extremity of ill fortune
  but i forbear the further threading of 
  proverbs
  lest i seem to have pilfered my friend erasmus  adages
  fortune 
  loves those that have least wit and most confidence and such as like that 
  saying of caesar
  
 the die is thrown
 
  but wisdom makes men bashful
  
  which is the reason that those wise men have so little to do
  unless it 
  be with poverty
  hunger
  and chimney corners
  that they live such 
  neglected
  unknown
  and hated lives
  whereas fools abound in money
  have 
  the chief commands in the commonwealth
  and in a word
  flourish every 
  way
  for if it be happiness to please princes and to be conversant among 
  those golden and diamond gods
  what is more unprofitable than wisdom
  or 
  what is it these kind of men have
  may more justly be censured
  if wealth 
  is to be got
  how little good at it is that merchant like to do
  if 
  following the precepts of wisdom
  he should boggle at perjury
  or being 
  taken in a lie
  blush
  or in the least regard the sad scruples of those 
  wise men touching rapine and usury
  again
  if a man sue for honors or 
  church preferments
  an ass or wild ox shall sooner get them than a wise 
  man
  if a man s in love with a young wench
  none of the least humors in 
  this comedy
  they are wholly addicted to fools and are afraid of a wise 
  man and fly him as they would a scorpion
  lastly
  whoever intend to live 
  merry and frolic
  shut their doors against wise men and admit anything 
  sooner
  in brief
  go whither you will
  among prelates
  princes
  judges
  
  magistrates
  friends
  enemies
  from highest to lowest
  and you ll find 
  all things done by money
  which
  as a wise man condemns it
  so it takes a 
  special care not to come near him
  what shall i say
  there is no measure 
  or end of my praises
  and yet  tis fit my oration have an end
  and 
  therefore i ll even break off
  and yet
  before i do it
   twill not be 
  amiss if i briefly show you that there has not been wanting even great 
  authors that have made me famous
  both by their writings and actions
  
  lest perhaps otherwise i may seem to have foolishly pleased myself only
  
  or that the lawyers charge me that i have proved nothing
  after their 
  example
  therefore
  will i allege my proofs
  that is to say
  nothing to 
  the point
  
   
  and first
  every man allows this proverb
  
 that where a man wants matter
  
  he may best frame some
 
  and to this purpose is that verse which we teach 
  children
  
  tis the greatest wisdom to know when and where to counterfeit 
  the fool
 
  and now judge yourselves what an excellent thing this folly 
  is
  whose very counterfeit and semblance only has got such praise from 
  the learned
  but more candidly does that fat plump 
 epicurean bacon hog
 
  
  horace
  for so he calls himself
  bid us 
 mingle our purposes with folly
 
  
  and whereas he adds the word  bravem 
  short
  perhaps to help out the 
  verse
  he might as well have let it alone
  and again
  
  tis a pleasant 
  thing to play the fool in the right season
 
  and in another place
  he had 
  rather 
 be accounted a dotterel and sot than to be wise and made mouths 
  at
 
  and telemachus in homer
  whom the poet praises so much
  is now and 
  then called  nepios 
  fool
  and by the same name
  as if there were some 
  good fortune in it
  are the tragedians wont to call boys and striplings
  
  and what does that sacred book of iliads contain but a kind of 
  counter scuffle between foolish kings and foolish people
  besides
  how 
  absolute is that praise that cicero gives of it
  
 all things are full of 
  fools
 
  for who does not know that every good
  the more diffusive it is
  
  by so much the better it is
  
   
  but perhaps their authority may be of small credit among christians
  
  we ll therefore
  if you please
  support our praises with some testimonies 
  of holy writ also
  in the first place
  nevertheless
  having forespoke our 
  theologians that they ll give us leave to do it without offense
  and in 
  the next
  forasmuch as we attempt a matter of some difficulty and it may 
  be perhaps a little too saucy to call back again the muses from helicon 
  to so great a journey
  especially in a matter they are wholly strangers 
  to
  it will be more suitable
  perhaps
  while i play the divine and make 
  my way through such prickly quiddities
  that i entreat the soul of 
  scotus
  a thing more bristly than either porcupine or hedgehog
  to leave 
  his scorebone awhile and come into my breast
  and then let him go whither 
  he pleases
  or to the dogs
  i could wish also that i might change my 
  countenance
  or that i had on the square cap and the cassock
  for fear 
  some or other should impeach me of theft as if i had privily rifled our 
  masters  desks in that i have got so much divinity
  but it ought not to 
  seem so strange if after so long and intimate an acquaintance and 
  converse with them i have picked up somewhat
  when as that fig tree god 
  priapus hearing his owner read certain greek words took so much notice of 
  them that he got them by heart
  and that cock in lucian by having lived 
  long among men became at last a master of their language
  
   
  but to the point under a fortunate direction
  ecclesiastes says in his 
  first chapter
  
 the number of fools is infinite
 
  and when he calls it 
  infinite
  does he not seem to comprehend all men
  unless it be some few 
  whom yet  tis a question whether any man ever saw
  but more ingeniously 
  does jeremiah in his tenth chapter confess it
  saying
  
 every man is made 
  a fool through his own wisdom
 
  attributing wisdom to god alone and 
  leaving folly to all men else
  and again
  
 let not man glory in his 
  wisdom
 
  and why
  good jeremiah
  would you not have a man glory in his 
  wisdom
  because
  he ll say
  he has none at all
  but to return to 
  ecclesiastes
  who
  when he cries out
  
 vanity of vanities
  all is 
  vanity
 
  what other thoughts had he
  do you believe
  than that
  as i said 
  before
  the life of man is nothing else but an interlude of folly
  in 
  which he has added one voice more to that justly received praise of 
  cicero s which i quoted before
  viz
 
  
 all things are full of fools
 
  
  again
  that wise preacher that said
  
 a fool changes as the moon
  but a 
  wise man is permanent as the sun
 
  what else did he hint at in it but 
  that all mankind are fools and the name of wise only proper to god
  for 
  by the moon interpreters understand human nature
  and by the sun
  god
  
  the only fountain of light
  with which agrees that which christ himself 
  in the gospel denies
  that anyone is to be called good but one
  and that 
  is god
  and then if he is a fool that is not wise
  and every good man 
  according to the stoics is a wise man
  it is no wonder if all mankind be 
  concluded under folly
  again solomon
  chapter 15
  
 foolishness
 
  says he
  
  
 is joy to the fool
 
  thereby plainly confessing that without folly there 
  is no pleasure in life
  to which is pertinent that other
  
 he that 
  increases knowledge
  increases grief
  and in much understanding there is 
  much indignation
 
  and does he not plainly confess as much
  chapter 7
  
  
 the heart of the wise is where sadness is
  but the heart of fools 
  follows mirth
 
  by which you see
  he thought it not enough to have 
  learned wisdom without he had added the knowledge of me also
  and if you 
  will not believe me
  take his own words
  chapter 1
  
 i gave my heart to 
  know wisdom and knowledge
  madness and folly
 
  where
  by the way
   tis 
  worth your remark that he intended me somewhat extraordinary that he 
  named me last
  a preacher wrote it
  and this you know is the order among 
  churchmen
  that he that is first in dignity comes last in place
  as 
  mindful
  no doubt
  whatever they do in other things
  herein at least to 
  observe the evangelical precept
  
   
  besides
  that folly is more excellent than wisdom the son of sirach
  
  whoever he was
  clearly witnesses
  chapter 44
  whose words
  so help me
  
  hercules
  i shall not once utter before you meet my induction with a 
  suitable answer
  according to the manner of those in plato that dispute 
  with socrates
  what things are more proper to be laid up with care
  such 
  as are rare and precious
  or such as are common and of no account
  why do 
  you give me no answer
  well
  though you should dissemble
  the greek 
  proverb will answer for you
  
 foul water is thrown out of doors
 
  which
  
  if any man shall be so ungracious as to condemn
  let him know  tis 
  aristotle s
  the god of our masters
  is there any of you so very a fool 
  as to leave jewels and gold in the street
  in truth
  i think not
  in the 
  most secret part of your house
  nor is that enough
  if there be any 
  drawer in your iron chests more private than other
  there you lay them
  
  but dirt you throw out of doors
  and therefore
  if you so carefully lay 
  up such things as you value and throw away what s vile and of no worth
  
  is it not plain that wisdom
  which he forbids a man to hide
  is of less 
  account than folly
  which he commands him to cover
  take his own words
  
  
 better is the man that hideth his folly than he that hideth his wisdom
 
  
  or what is that
  when he attributes an upright mind without craft or 
  malice to a fool
  when a wise man the while thinks no man like himself
  
  for so i understand that in his tenth chapter
  
 a fool walking by the 
  way
  being a fool himself
  supposes all men to be fools like him
 
  and is 
  it not a sign of great integrity to esteem every man as good as himself
  
  and when there is no one that leans not too much to other way
  to be so 
  frank yet as to divide his praises with another
  nor was this great king 
  ashamed of the name when he says of himself that he is more foolish than 
  any man
  nor did paul
  that great doctor of the gentiles
  writing to the 
  corinthians
  unwillingly acknowledge it
  
 i speak
 
  says he
  
 like a 
  fool
  i am more
 
  as if it could be any dishonor to excel in folly
  
   
  but here i meet with a great noise of some that endeavor to peck out the 
  crows  eyes
  that is
  to blind the doctors of our times and smoke out 
  their eyes with new annotations
  among whom my friend erasmus
  whom for 
  honor s sake i often mention
  deserves if not the first place yet 
  certainly the second
  o most foolish instance
  they cry
  and well 
  becoming folly herself
  the apostle s meaning was wide enough from what 
  you dream
  for he spoke it not in this sense
  that he would have them 
  believe him a greater fool than the rest
  but when he had said
  
 they are 
  ministers of christ
  the same am i
 
  and by way of boasting herein had 
  equaled himself with to others
  he added this by way of correction or 
  checking himself
  
 i am more
 
  as meaning that he was not only equal to 
  the rest of the apostles in the work of the gospel
  but somewhat 
  superior
  and therefore
  while he would have this received as a truth
  
  lest nevertheless it might not relish their ears as being spoken with too 
  much arrogance
  he foreshortened his argument with the vizard of folly
  
  
 i speak like a fool
 
  because he knew it was the prerogative of fools to 
  speak what they like
  and that too without offense
  whatever he thought 
  when he wrote this
  i leave it to them to discuss
  for my own part
  i 
  follow those fat
  fleshy
  and vulgarly approved doctors
  with whom
  by 
  jupiter
  a great part of the learned had rather err than follow them that 
  understand the tongues
  though they are never so much in the right
  not 
  any of them make greater account of those smatterers at greek than if 
  they were daws
  especially when a no small professor
  whose name i 
  wittingly conceal lest those choughs should chatter at me that greek 
  proverb i have so often mentioned
  
 an ass at a harp
 
  discoursing 
  magisterially and theologically on this text
  
 i speak as a fool
  i am 
  more
 
  drew a new thesis
  and
  which without the height of logic he could 
  never have done
  made this new subdivision  for i ll give you his own 
  words
  not only in form but matter also  
 i speak like a fool
 
  that is
  
  if you look upon me as a fool for comparing myself with those false 
  apostles
  i shall seem yet a greater fool by esteeming myself before 
  them
  though the same person a little after
  as forgetting himself
  runs 
  off to another matter
  
   
  but why do i thus staggeringly defend myself with one single instance
  as 
  if it were not the common privilege of divines to stretch heaven
  that is 
  holy writ
  like a cheverel
  and when there are many things in st
  paul 
  that thwart themselves
  which yet in their proper place do well enough if 
  there be any credit to be given to st
  jerome that was master of five 
  tongues
  such was that of his at athens when having casually espied the 
  inscription of that altar
  he wrested it into an argument to prove the 
  christian faith
  and leaving out all the other words because they made 
  against him
  took notice only of the two last
  viz
 
  
 to the unknown 
  god
 
  and those too not without some alteration
  for the whole 
  inscription was thus
  
 to the gods of asia
  europe
  and africa
  to the 
  unknown and strange gods
 
  and according to his example do the sons of 
  the prophets
  who
  forcing out here and there four or five expressions 
  and if need be corrupting the sense
  wrest it to their own purpose
  
  though what goes before and follows after make nothing to the matter in 
  hand
  nay
  be quite against it
  which yet they do with so happy an 
  impudence that oftentimes the civilians envy them that faculty
  
   
  for what is it in a manner they may not hope for success in
  when this 
  great doctor  i had almost bolted out his name
  but that i once again 
  stand in fear of the greek proverb  has made a construction on an 
  expression of luke
  so agreeable to the mind of christ as are fire and 
  water to one another
  for when the last point of danger was at hand
  at 
  which time retainers and dependents are wont in a more special manner to 
  attend their protectors
  to examine what strength they have
  and prepare 
  for the encounter
  christ
  intending to take out of his disciples  minds 
  all trust and confidence in such like defense
  demands of them whether 
  they wanted anything when he sent them forth so unprovided for a journey 
  that they had neither shoes to defend their feet from the injuries of 
  stones and briars nor the provision of a scrip to preserve them from 
  hunger
  and when they had denied that they wanted anything
  he adds
  
 but 
  now
  he that hath a bag
  let him take it
  and likewise a scrip
  and he 
  that hath none
  let him sell his coat and buy a sword
 
  and now when the 
  sum of all that christ taught pressed only meekness
  suffering
  and 
  contempt of life
  who does not clearly perceive what he means in this 
  place
  to wit
  that he might the more disarm his ministers
  that 
  neglecting not only shoes and scrip but throwing away their very coat
  
  they might
  being in a manner naked
  the more readily and with less 
  hindrance take in hand the work of the gospel
  and provide themselves of 
  nothing but a sword
  not such as thieves and murderers go up and down 
  with
  but the sword of the spirit that pierces the most inward parts
  and 
  so cuts off as it were at one blow all earthly affections
  that they mind 
  nothing but their duty to god
  but see
  i pray
  whither this famous 
  theologian wrests it
  by the sword he interprets defense against 
  persecution
  and by the bag sufficient provision to carry it on
  as if 
  christ having altered his mind
  in that he sent out his disciples not so 
  royally attended as he should have done
  repented himself of his former 
  instructions
  or as forgetting that he had said
  
 blessed are ye when ye 
  are evil spoken of
  despised
  and persecuted
  etc
 
 
  and forbade them to 
  resist evil
  for that the meek in spirit
  not the proud
  are blessed
  or
  
  lest remembering
  i say
  that he had compared them to sparrows and 
  lilies
  thereby minding them what small care they should take for the 
  things of this life
  was so far now from having them go forth without a 
  sword that he commanded them to get one
  though with the sale of their 
  coat
  and had rather they should go naked than want a brawling iron by 
  their sides
  and to this
  as under the word 
 sword
  he conceives to be 
  comprehended whatever appertains to the repelling of injuries
  so under 
  that of 
 scrip
  he takes in whatever is necessary to the support of life
  
  and so does this deep interpreter of the divine meaning bring forth the 
  apostles to preach the doctrine of a crucified christ
  but furnished at 
  all points with lances
  slings
  quarterstaffs
  and bombards
  lading them 
  also with bag and baggage
  lest perhaps it might not be lawful for them 
  to leave their inn unless they were empty and fasting
  nor does he take 
  the least notice of this
  that he so willed the sword to be bought
  
  reprehends it a little after and commands it to be sheathed
  and that it 
  was never heard that the apostles ever used or swords or bucklers against 
  the gentiles
  though  tis likely they had done it
  if christ had ever 
  intended
  as this doctor interprets
  
   
  there is another
  too
  whose name out of respect i pass by
  a man of no 
  small repute
  who from those tents which habakkuk mentions
  
 the tents of 
  the land of midian shall tremble
 
  drew this exposition
  that it was 
  prophesied of the skin of saint bartholomew who was flayed alive
  and 
  why
  forsooth
  but because those tents were covered with skins
  i was 
  lately myself at a theological dispute
  for i am often there
  where when 
  one was demanding what authority there was in holy writ that commands 
  heretics to be convinced by fire rather than reclaimed by argument
  a 
  crabbed old fellow
  and one whose supercilious gravity spoke him at least 
  a doctor
  answered in a great fume that saint paul had decreed it
  who 
  said
  
 reject him that is a heretic
  after once or twice admonition
 
  and 
  when he had sundry times
  one after another
  thundered out the same 
  thing
  and most men wondered what ailed the man
  at last he explained it 
  thus
  making two words of one
  
 a heretic must be put to death
 
  some 
  laughed
  and yet there wanted not others to whom this exposition seemed 
  plainly theological
  which
  when some
  though those very few
  opposed
  
  they cut off the dispute
  as we say
  with a hatchet
  and the credit of so 
  uncontrollable an author
  
 pray conceive me
 
  said he
  
 it is written
  
   thou shalt not suffer a witch to live
   but every heretic bewitches the 
  people
  therefore
  etc
 
  and now
  as many as were present admired the 
  man s wit
  and consequently submitted to his decision of the question
  
  nor came it into any of their heads that that law concerned only 
  fortunetellers
  enchanters
  and magicians
  whom the hebrews call in their 
  tongue 
 mecaschephim
 
  witches or sorcerers
  for otherwise
  perhaps
  
  by the same reason it might as well have extended to fornication 
  and drunkenness
  
   
  but i foolishly run on in these matters
  though yet there are so many of 
  them that neither chrysippus  nor didymus  volumes are large enough to 
  contain them
  i would only desire you to consider this
  that if so great 
  doctors may be allowed this liberty
  you may the more reasonably pardon 
  even me also
  a raw
  effeminate divine
  if i quote not everything so 
  exactly as i should
  and so at last i return to paul
  
 ye willingly
 
  
  says he
  
 suffer my foolishness
 
  and again
  
 take me as a fool
 
  and 
  further
  
 i speak it not after the lord
  but as it were foolishly
 
  and 
  in another place
  
 we are fools for christ s sake
 
  you have heard from 
  how great an author how great praises of folly
  and to what other end
  
  but that without doubt he looked upon it as that one thing both necessary 
  and profitable
  
 if anyone among ye
 
  says he
  
 seem to be wise
  let him 
  be a fool that he may be wise
 
  and in luke
  jesus called those two 
  disciples with whom he joined himself upon the way
  
 fools
 
  nor can i 
  give you any reason why it should seem so strange when saint paul imputes 
  a kind of folly even to god himself
  
 the foolishness of god
 
  says he
  
  
 is wiser than men
 
  though yet i must confess that origin upon the place 
  denies that this foolishness may be resembled to the uncertain judgment 
  of men
  of which kind is
  that 
 the preaching of the cross is to them 
  that perish foolishness
 
  
   
  but why am i so careful to no purpose that i thus run on to prove my 
  matter by so many testimonies
  when in those mystical psalms christ 
  speaking to the father says openly
  
 thou knowest my foolishness
 
  nor is 
  it without ground that fools are so acceptable to god
  the reason perhaps 
  may be this
  that as princes carry a suspicious eye upon those that are 
  over wise
  and consequently hate them  as caesar did brutus and cassius
  
  when he feared not in the least drunken antony
  so nero
  seneca
  and 
  dionysius
  plato  and on the contrary are delighted in those blunter and 
  unlabored wits
  in like manner christ ever abhors and condemns those wise 
  men and such as put confidence in their own wisdom
  and this paul makes 
  clearly out when he said
  
 god hath chosen the foolish things of this 
  world
 
  as well knowing it had been impossible to have reformed it by 
  wisdom
  which also he sufficiently declares himself
  crying out by the 
  mouth of his prophet
  
 i will destroy the wisdom of the wise
  and cast 
  away the understanding of the prudent
 
  
   
  and again
  when christ gives him thanks that he had concealed the mystery 
  of salvation from the wise
  but revealed it to babes and sucklings
  that 
  is to say
  fools
  for the greek word for babes is fools
  which he opposes 
  to the word wise men
  to this appertains that throughout the gospel you 
  find him ever accusing the scribes and pharisees and doctors of the law
  
  but diligently defending the ignorant multitude  for what other is that 
  
 woe to ye scribes and pharisees
  than woe to you
  you wise men
  
  but 
  seems chiefly delighted in little children
  women
  and fishers
  besides
  
  among brute beasts he is best pleased with those that have least in them 
  of the foxes  subtlety
  and therefore he chose rather to ride upon an ass 
  when
  if he had pleased
  he might have bestrode the lion without danger
  
  and the holy ghost came down in the shape of a dove
  not of an eagle or 
  kite
  add to this that in scripture there is frequent mention of harts
  
  hinds
  and lambs
  and such as are destined to eternal life are called 
  sheep
  than which creature there is not anything more foolish
  if we may 
  believe that proverb of aristotle 
 sheepish manners
 
  which he tells us 
  is taken from the foolishness of that creature and is used to be applied 
  to dull headed people and lack wits
  and yet christ professes to be the 
  shepherd of this flock and is himself delighted with the name of a lamb
  
  according to saint john
  
 behold the lamb of god
 
  of which also there is 
  much mention in the revelation
  and what does all this drive at
  but that 
  all mankind are fools  nay
  even the very best
  
   
  and christ himself
  that he might the better relieve this folly
  being 
  the wisdom of the father
  yet in some manner became a fool when taking 
  upon him the nature of man
  he was found in shape as a man
  as in like 
  manner he was made sin that he might heal sinners
  nor did he work this 
  cure any other way than by the foolishness of the cross and a company of 
  fat apostles
  not much better
  to whom also he carefully recommended 
  folly but gave them a caution against wisdom and drew them together by 
  the example of little children
  lilies
  mustard seed
  and sparrows
  
  things senseless and inconsiderable
  living only by the dictates of 
  nature and without either craft or care
  besides
  when he forbade them to 
  be troubled about what they should say before governors and straightly 
  charged them not to inquire after times and seasons
  to wit
  that they 
  might not trust to their own wisdom but wholly depend on him
  and to the 
  same purpose is it that that great architect of the world
  god
  gave man 
  an injunction against his eating of the tree of knowledge
  as if 
  knowledge were the bane of happiness
  according to which also
  st
  paul 
  disallows it as puffing up and destructive
  whence also st
  bernard seems 
  in my opinion to follow when he interprets that mountain whereon lucifer 
  had fixed his habitation to be the mountain of knowledge
  
   
  nor perhaps ought i to omit this other argument
  that folly is so 
  gracious above that her errors are only pardoned
  those of wise men 
  never
  whence it is that they that ask forgiveness
  though they offend 
  never so wittingly
  cloak it yet with the excuse of folly
  so aaron
  in 
  numbers
  if i mistake not the book
  when he sues unto moses concerning 
  his sister s leprosy
  
 i beseech thee
  my lord
  not to lay this sin upon 
  us
  which we have foolishly committed
 
  so saul makes his excuse of 
  david
  
 for behold
 
  says he
  
 i did it foolishly
 
  and again
  david 
  himself thus sweetens god
  
 and therefore i beseech thee
  o lord
  to take 
  away the trespass of thy servant
  for i have done foolishly
 
  as if he 
  knew there was no pardon to be obtained unless he had colored his offense 
  with folly and ignorance
  and stronger is that of christ upon the cross 
  when he prayed for his enemies
  
 father
  forgive them
 
  nor does he cover 
  their crime with any other excuse than that of unwittingness  because
  
  says he
  
 they know not what they do
 
  in like manner paul
  writing to 
  timothy
  
 but therefore i obtained mercy
  for that i did it ignorantly 
  through unbelief
 
  and what is the meaning of 
 i did it ignorantly
  but 
  that i did it out of folly
  not malice
  and what of 
 therefore i received 
  mercy
  but that i had not obtained it had i not been made more allowable 
  through the covert of folly
  for us also makes that mystical psalmist
  
  though i remembered it not in its right place
  
 remember not the sins of 
  my youth nor my ignorances
 
  you see what two things he pretends
  to wit
  
  youth
  whose companion i ever am
  and ignorances
  and that in the plural 
  number
  a number of multitude
  whereby we are to understand that there 
  was no small company of them
  
   
  but not to run too far in that which is infinite
  to speak briefly
  all 
  christian religion seems to have a kind of alliance with folly and in no 
  respect to have any accord with wisdom
  of which if you expect proofs
  
  consider first that boys
  old men
  women
  and fools are more delighted 
  with religious and sacred things than others
  and to that purpose are 
  ever next the altars
  and this they do by mere impulse of nature
  and in 
  the next place
  you see that those first founders of it were plain
  
  simple persons and most bitter enemies of learning
  lastly there are no 
  sort of fools seem more out of the way than are these whom the zeal of 
  christian religion has once swallowed up
  so that they waste their 
  estates
  neglect injuries
  suffer themselves to be cheated
  put no 
  difference between friends and enemies
  abhor pleasure
  are crammed with 
  poverty
  watchings
  tears
  labors
  reproaches
  loathe life
  and wish 
  death above all things
  in short
  they seem senseless to common 
  understanding
  as if their minds lived elsewhere and not in their own 
  bodies
  which
  what else is it than to be mad
  for which reason you must 
  not think it so strange if the apostles seemed to be drunk with new wine
  
  and if paul appeared to festus to be mad
  
   
  but now
  having once gotten on the lion s skin
  go to
  and i ll show you 
  that this happiness of christians
  which they pursue with so much toil
  
  is nothing else but a kind of madness and folly
  far be it that my words 
  should give any offense
  rather consider my matter
  and first
  the 
  christians and platonists do as good as agree in this
  that the soul is 
  plunged and fettered in the prison of the body
  by the grossness of which 
  it is so tied up and hindered that it cannot take a view of or enjoy 
  things as they truly are
  and for that cause their master defines 
  philosophy to be a contemplation of death
  because it takes off the mind 
  from visible and corporeal objects
  than which death does no more
  and 
  therefore
  as long as the soul uses the organs of the body in that right 
  manner it ought
  so long it is said to be in good state and condition
  
  but when
  having broken its fetters
  it endeavors to get loose and 
  assays
  as it were
  a flight out of that prison that holds it in
  they 
  call it madness
  and if this happen through any distemper or 
  indisposition of the organs
  then
  by the common consent of every man
  
   tis downright madness
  and yet we see such kind of men foretell things 
  to come
  understand tongues and letters they never learned before
  and 
  seem
  as it were
  big with a kind of divinity
  nor is it to be doubted 
  but that it proceeds from hence
  that the mind
  being somewhat at liberty 
  from the infection of the body
  begins to put forth itself in its native 
  vigor
  and i conceive  tis from the same cause that the like often 
  happens to sick men a little before their death
  that they discourse in 
  strain above mortality as if they were inspired
  again
  if this happens 
  upon the score of religion
  though perhaps it may not be the same kind of 
  madness
  yet  tis so near it that a great many men would judge it no 
  better
  especially when a few inconsiderable people shall differ from the 
  rest of the world in the whole course of their life
  and therefore it 
  fares with them as
  according to the fiction of plato
  happens to those 
  that being cooped up in a cave stand gaping with admiration at the 
  shadows of things
  and that fugitive who
  having broke from them and 
  returning to them again
  told them he had seen things truly as they were
  
  and that they were the most mistaken in believing there was nothing but 
  pitiful shadows
  for as this wise man pitied and bewailed their palpable 
  madness that were possessed with so gross an error
  so they in return 
  laughed at him as a doting fool and cast him out of their company
  in 
  like manner the common sort of men chiefly admire those things that are 
  most corporeal and almost believe there is nothing beyond them
  whereas 
  on the contrary
  these devout persons
  by how much the nearer anything 
  concerns the body
  by so much more they neglect it and are wholly hurried 
  away with the contemplation of things invisible
  for the one give the 
  first place to riches
  the next to their corporeal pleasures
  leaving the 
  last place to their soul
  which yet most of them do scarce believe
  
  because they can t see it with their eyes
  on the contrary
  the others 
  first rely wholly on god
  the most unchangeable of all things
  and next 
  him
  yet on this that comes nearest him
  they bestow the second on their 
  soul
  and lastly
  for their body
  they neglect that care and condemn and 
  fly money as superfluity that may be well spared
  or if they are forced 
  to meddle with any of these things
  they do it carelessly and much 
  against their wills
  having as if they had it not
  and possessing as if 
  they possessed it not
  
   
  there are also in each several things several degrees wherein they 
  disagree among themselves
  and first as to the senses
  though all of them 
  have more or less affinity with the body
  yet of these some are more 
  gross and blockish
  as tasting
  hearing
  seeing
  smelling
  touching
  some 
  more removed from the body
  as memory
  intellect
  and the will
  and 
  therefore to which of these the mind applies itself
  in that lies its 
  force
  but holy men
  because the whole bent of their minds is taken up 
  with those things that are most repugnant to these grosser senses
  they 
  seem brutish and stupid in the common use of them
  whereas on the 
  contrary
  the ordinary sort of people are best at these
  and can do least 
  at the other
  from whence it is
  as we have heard
  that some of these 
  holy men have by mistake drunk oil for wine
  again
  in the affections of 
  the mind
  some have a greater commerce with the body than others
  as 
  lust
  desire of meat and sleep
  anger
  pride
  envy
  with which holy men 
  are at irreconcilable enmity
  and contrary
  the common people think 
  there s no living without them
  and lastly there are certain middle kind 
  of affections
  and as it were natural to every man
  as the love of one s 
  country
  children
  parents
  friends
  and to which the common people 
  attribute no small matter
  whereas the other strive to pluck them out of 
  their mind
  unless insomuch as they arrive to that highest part of the 
  soul
  that they love their parents not as parents  for what did they get 
  but the body
  though yet we owe it to god
  not them  but as good men or 
  women and in whom shines the image of that highest wisdom which alone 
  they call the chiefest good
  and out of which
  they say
  there is nothing 
  to be beloved or desired
  
   
  and by the same rule do they measure all things else
  so that they make 
  less account of whatever is visible
  unless it be altogether 
  contemptible
  than of those things which they cannot see
  but they say 
  that in sacraments and other religious duties there is both body and 
  spirit
  as in fasting they count it not enough for a man to abstain from 
  eating
  which the common people take for an absolute fast
  unless there 
  be also a lessening of his depraved affections
  as that he be less angry
  
  less proud
  than he was wont
  that the spirit
  being less clogged with 
  its bodily weight
  may be the more intent upon heavenly things
  in like 
  manner
  in the eucharist
  though
  say they
  it is not to be esteemed the 
  less that  tis administered with ceremonies
  yet of itself  tis of little 
  effect
  if not hurtful
  unless that which is spiritual be added to it
  to 
  wit
  that which is represented under those visible signs
  now the death 
  of christ is represented by it
  which all men
  vanquishing
  abolishing
  
  and
  as it were
  burying their carnal affections
  ought to express in 
  their lives and conversations that they may grow up to a newness of life 
  and be one with him and the same one among another
  this a holy man does
  
  and in this is his only meditation
  whereas on the contrary
  the common 
  people think there s no more in that sacrifice than to be present at the 
  altar and crowd next it
  to have a noise of words and look upon the 
  ceremonies
  nor in this alone
  which we only proposed by way of example
  
  but in all his life
  and without hypocrisy
  does a holy man fly those 
  things that have any alliance with the body and is wholly ravished with 
  things eternal
  invisible
  and spiritual
  for which cause there s so 
  great contrarity of opinion between them
  and that too in everything
  
  that each party thinks the other out of their wits
  though that 
  character
  in my judgment
  better agrees with those holy men than the 
  common people
  which yet will be more clear if
  as i promised
  i briefly 
  show you that that great reward they so much fancy is nothing else but a 
  kind of madness
  
   
  and therefore suppose that plato dreamed of somewhat like it when he 
  called the madness of lovers the most happy condition of all others
  for 
  he that s violently in love lives not in his own body but in the thing he 
  loves
  and by how much the farther he runs from himself into another
  by 
  so much the greater is his pleasure
  and then
  when the mind strives to 
  rove from its body and does not rightly use its own organs
  without doubt 
  you may say  tis downright madness and not be mistaken
  or otherwise 
  what s the meaning of those common sayings
  
 he does not dwell at home
 
  
  
 come to yourself
 
  
 he s his own man again
 
  besides
  the more perfect 
  and true his love is
  the more pleasant is his madness
  and therefore
  
  what is that life hereafter
  after which these holy minds so pantingly 
  breathe
  like to be
  to wit
  the spirit shall swallow up the body
  as 
  conqueror and more durable
  and this it shall do with the greater ease 
  because heretofore
  in its lifetime
  it had cleansed and thinned it into 
  such another nothing as itself
  and then the spirit again shall be 
  wonderfully swallowed up by the highest mind
  as being more powerful than 
  infinite parts
  so that the whole man is to be out of himself nor to be 
  otherwise happy in any respect
  but that being stripped of himself
  he 
  shall participate of somewhat ineffable from that chiefest good that 
  draws all things into itself
  and this happiness though  tis only then 
  perfected when souls being joined to their former bodies shall be made 
  immortal
  yet forasmuch as the life of holy men is nothing but a 
  continued meditation and
  as it were
  shadow of that life
  it so happens 
  that at length they have some taste or relish of it
  which
  though it be 
  but as the smallest drop in comparison of that fountain of eternal 
  happiness
  yet it far surpasses all worldly delight
  though all the 
  pleasures of all mankind were all joined together
  so much better are 
  things spiritual than things corporeal
  and things invisible than things 
  visible
  which doubtless is that which the prophet promises
  
 the eye 
  hath not seen
  nor the ear heard
  nor has it entered into the heart of 
  man to consider what god has provided for them that love him
 
  and this 
  is that mary s better part which is not taken away by change of life
  
  but perfected
  
   
  and therefore they that are sensible of it
  and few there are to whom 
  this happens
  suffer a kind of somewhat little differing from madness
  
  for they utter many things that do not hang together
  and that too not 
  after the manner of men but make a kind of sound which they neither heed 
  themselves
  nor is it understood by others
  and change the whole figure 
  of their countenance
  one while jocund
  another while dejected
  now 
  weeping
  then laughing
  and again sighing
  and when they come to 
  themselves
  tell you they know not where they have been
  whether in the 
  body or out of the body
  or sleeping
  nor do they remember what they have 
  heard
  seen
  spoken
  or done
  and only know this
  as it were in a mist or 
  dream
  that they were the most happy while they were so out of their 
  wits
  and therefore they are sorry they are come to themselves again and 
  desire nothing more than this kind of madness
  to be perpetually mad
  and 
  this is a small taste of that future happiness
  
   
  but i forget myself and run beyond my bounds
  though yet
  if i shall seem 
  to have spoken anything more boldly or impertinently than i ought
  be 
  pleased to consider that not only folly but a woman said it
  remembering 
  in the meantime that greek proverb
  
 sometimes a fool may speak a word in 
  season
 
  unless perhaps you expect an epilogue
  but give me leave to tell 
  you you are mistaken if you think i remember anything of what i have 
  said
  having foolishly bolted out such a hodgepodge of words
   tis an old 
  proverb
  
 i hate one that remembers what s done over the cup
 
  this is a 
  new one of my own making
  i hate a man that remembers what he hears
  
  wherefore farewell
  clap your hands
  live and drink lustily
  my most 
  excellent disciples of folly
