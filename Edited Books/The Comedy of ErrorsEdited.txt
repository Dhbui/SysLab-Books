   duke
   merchant of syracusa
  plead no more
  
  i am not partial to infringe our laws
  
  the enmity and discord which of late                                 5 
  sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke 
  to merchants
  our well dealing countrymen
  
  who
  wanting guilders to redeem their lives
  
  have seal d his rigorous statutes with their bloods
  
  excludes all pity from our threatening looks
                        10 
  for
  since the mortal and intestine jars 
   twixt thy seditious countrymen and us
  
  it hath in solemn synods been decreed
  
  both by the syracusians and ourselves
  
  to admit no traffic to our adverse towns
                            15 
  nay
  more
  
  if any born at ephesus be seen 
  at any syracusian marts and fairs
  
  again
  if any syracusian born 
  come to the bay of ephesus
  he dies
                                 20 
  his goods confiscate to the duke s dispose
  
  unless a thousand marks be levied
  
  to quit the penalty and to ransom him
  
  thy substance
  valued at the highest rate
  
  cannot amount unto a hundred marks
                                  25 
  therefore by law thou art condemn d to die
  
   
    ge
   yet this my comfort
  when your words are done
  
  my woes end likewise with the evening sun

  say
  in brief
  the cause 
  why thou departed st from thy native home
                           30 
  and for what cause thou camest to ephesus
  
   
    ge
   a heavier task could not have been imposed 
  than i to speak my griefs unspeakable
  
  yet
  that the world may witness that my end 
  was wrought by nature
  not by vile offence
                          35 
  i ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave
  
  in syracusa was i born
  and wed 
  unto a woman
  happy but for me
  
  and by me
  had not our hap been bad
  
  with her i lived in joy
  our wealth increased                       40 
  by prosperous voyages i often made 
  to epidamnum
  till my factor s death
  
  and the great care of goods at random left
  
  drew me from kind embracements of my spouse
  
  from whom my absence was not six months old
                         45 
  before herself
  almost at fainting under 
  the pleasing punishment that women bear
  
  had made provision for her following me
  
  and soon and safe arrived where i was
  
  there had she not been long but she became                          50 
  a joyful mother of two goodly sons
  
  and
  which was strange
  the one so like the other 
  as could not be distinguish d but by names
  
  that very hour
  and in the self same inn
  
  a meaner woman was delivered                                        55 
  of such a burden
  male twins
  both alike
  
  those
  for their parents were exceeding poor
  
  i bought
  and brought up to attend my sons
  
  my wife
  not meanly proud of two such boys
  
  made daily motions for our home return
                              60 
  unwilling i agreed
  alas
  too soon 
  we came aboard
  
  a league from epidamnum had we sail d
  
  before the always wind obeying deep 
  gave any tragic instance of our harm
                                65 
  but longer did we not retain much hope
  
  for what obscured light the heavens did grant 
  did but convey unto our fearful minds 
  a doubtful warrant of immediate death
  
  which though myself would gladly have embraced
                      70 
  yet the incessant weepings of my wife
  
  weeping before for what she saw must come
  
  and piteous plainings of the pretty babes
  
  that mourn d for fashion
  ignorant what to fear
  
  forced me to seek delays for them and me
                            75 
  and this it was
  for other means was none
  
  the sailors sought for safety by our boat
  
  and left the ship
  then sinking ripe
  to us
  
  my wife
  more careful for the latter born
  
  had fasten d him unto a small spare mast
                            80 
  such as seafaring men provide for storms
  
  to him one of the other twins was bound
  
  whilst i had been like heedful of the other
  
  the children thus disposed
  my wife and i
  
  fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix d
                          85 
  fasten d ourselves at either end the mast
  
  and floating straight
  obedient to the stream
  
  was carried towards corinth
  as we thought
  
  at length the sun
  gazing upon the earth
  
  dispersed those vapours that offended us
                            90 
  and
  by the benefit of his wished light
  
  the seas wax d calm
  and we discovered 
  two ships from far making amain to us
  
  of corinth that
  of epidaurus this
  
  but ere they came
   o
  let me say no more
                           95

   duke
   nay
  forward
  old man
  do not break off so
  
  for we may pity
  though not pardon thee
  
   
    ge
   o
  had the gods done so
  i had not now 
  worthily term d them merciless to us
                               100 
  for
  ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues
  
  we were encounter d by a mighty rock
  
  which being violently borne upon
  
  our helpful ship was splitted in the midst
  
  so that
  in this unjust divorce of us
                              105 
  fortune had left to both of us alike 
  what to delight in
  what to sorrow for
  
  her part
  poor soul
  seeming as burdened 
  with lesser weight
  but not with lesser woe
  
  was carried with more speed before the wind
                        110 
  and in our sight they three were taken up 
  by fishermen of corinth
  as we thought
  
  at length
  another ship had seized on us
  
  and
  knowing whom it was their hap to save
  
  gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck d guests
                 115 
  and would have reft the fishers of their prey
  
  had not their bark been very slow of sail
  
  and therefore homeward did they bend their course
  
  thus have you heard me sever d from my bliss
  
  that by misfortunes was my life prolong d
                          120 
  to tell sad stories of my own mishaps
  
   
   duke
   and
  for the sake of them thou sorrowest for
  
  do me the favour to dilate at full 
  what hath befall n of them and thee till now
  
   
    ge
   my youngest boy
  and yet my eldest care
                     125 
  at eighteen years became inquisitive 
  after his brother
  and importuned me 
  that his attendant  so his case was like
  
  reft of his brother
  but retain d his name   
  might bear him company in the quest of him
                         130 
  whom whilst i labour d of a love to see
  
  i hazarded the loss of whom i loved
  
  five summers have i spent in furthest greece
  
  roaming clean through the bounds of asia
  
  and
  coasting homeward
  came to ephesus
                            135 
  hopeless to find
  yet loath to leave unsought 
  or that
  or any place that harbours men
  
  but here must end the story of my life
  
  and happy were i in my timely death
  
  could all my travels warrant me they live
                          140 
   
   duke
   hapless  geon
  whom the fates have mark d 
  to bear the extremity of dire mishap
  
  now
  trust me
  were it not against our laws
  
  against my crown
  my oath
  my dignity
  
  which princes
  would they
  may not disannul
                        145 
  my soul should sue as advocate for thee
  
  but
  though thou art adjudged to the death
  
  and passed sentence may not be recall d 
  but to our honour s great disparagement
  
  yet will i favour thee in what i can
                               150 
  therefore
  merchant
  i ll limit thee this day 
  to seek thy help by beneficial help
  
  try all the friends thou hast in ephesus
  
  beg thou
  or borrow
  to make up the sum

  if no
  then thou art doom d to die

  good sister
  let us dine

  a man is master of his liberty
  
  time is their master

  they ll go or come
  if so
  be patient

   why should their liberty than ours be more

  lords of the wide world and wild watery seas
  
  indued with intellectual sense and souls
  
  of more pre eminence than fish and fowls
  
  are masters to their females
  and their lords

  no marvel though she pause
  
  they can be meek that have no other cause

  bruised with adversity
  
  we bid be quiet when we hear it cry

  but were we burden d with like weight of pain
  
  as much
  or more
  we should ourselves complain
  
  so thou

  the reason that i gather he is mad
    
  besides this present instance of his rage
    
  is a mad tale he told to day at dinner
  
  of his own doors being shut against his entrance
  
  belike his wife

  by rushing in their houses
  bearing thence 
  rings
  jewels
  any thing his rage did like
  
  once did i get him bound
  and sent him home
                        145 
  whilst to take order for the wrongs i went
  
  that here and there his fury had committed
  
  anon
  i wot not by what strong escape
  
  he broke from those that had the guard of him
  
  and with his mad attendant and himself
                             150 
  each one with ireful passion
  with drawn swords
  
  met us again
  and
  madly bent on us
  
  chased us away
  till
  raising of more aid
  
  we came again to bind them
  then they fled 
  into this abbey
  whither we pursued them
                           155 
  and here the abbess shuts the gates on us
  
  and will not suffer us to fetch him out
  
  nor send him forth
  that we may bear him hence
  
  therefore
  most gracious duke
  with thy command 
  let him be brought forth
  and borne hence for help
                 160 
   
   duke
   long since thy husband served me in my wars
  
  and i to thee engaged a prince s word

  to do him all the grace and good i could
  
  go
  some of you
  knock at the abbey gate
                           165

  beaten the maids a row
  and bound the doctor

  whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire
  
  and ever
  as it blazed
  they threw on him 
  great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair
  
  my master preaches patience to him
  and the while 
  his man with scissors nicks him like a fool
                        175

  between them they will kill the conjurer

  who parted with me to go fetch a chain
  
  promising to bring it to the porpentine
  
  where balthazar and i did dine together
  
  our dinner done
  and he not coming thither
  
  i went to seek him
  in the street i met him
                        225 
  and in his company that gentleman
  
  there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down 
  that i this day of him received the chain
  
  which
  god he knows
  i saw not
  for the which 
  he did arrest me with an officer
                                   230 
  i did obey
  and sent my peasant home 
  for certain ducats
  he with none return d
  
  then fairly i bespoke the officer 
  to go in person with me to my house
  
  by the way we met my wife
  her sister
  and a rabble more           235 
  of vile confederates
  along with them 
  they brought one pinch
  a hungry lean faced villain
  
  a mere anatomy
  a mountebank
  
  a threadbare juggler
  and a fortune teller
  
  a needy
  hollow eyed
  sharp looking wretch
                         240 
  a living dead man
  this pernicious slave
  
  forsooth
  took on him as a conjurer

  gazing in mine eyes
  feeling my pulse

  outfacing me
  
  cries out

  bound me
  bore me thence

  there left me and my man
  both bound together

  gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder
  
  i gain d my freedom
