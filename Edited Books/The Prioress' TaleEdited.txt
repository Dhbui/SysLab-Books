   for foule usure and lucre of vileynye
  
   hateful to crist and to his compaignye
  
   and thurgh the strete men myghte ride or wende
  
   for it was free and open at eyther ende
  
   a litel scole of cristen folk ther stood 
   doun at the ferther ende
  in which ther were 
   children an heep
  ycomen of cristen blood
  
   that lerned in that scole yeer by yere 
   swich manere doctrine as men used there
  
  500 this is to seyn
  to syngen and to rede
  
   as smale children doon in hire childhede
  
   among thise children was a wydwes sone
  
   a litel clergeon

   that day by day to scole was his wone
  
   and eek also
  where as he saugh th  ymage 
   of cristes mooder

  and he forgat it naught
  
   for sely child wol alday soone leere
  
   but ay

   seint nicholas stant evere in my presence
  
   for he so yong to crist dide reverence

   and herkned ay the wordes and the noote
  
   til he the firste vers koude al by rote
  
   noght wiste he what this latyn was to seye
  
   for he so yong and tendre was of age
  
   but on a day his felawe gan he preye 
   t  expounden hym this song in his langage
  
   or telle hym why this song was in usage
  
   this preyde he hym to construe and declare 
   ful often tyme upon his knowes bare

  which that elder was than he
  
   answerde hym thus

   his felawe taughte hym homward prively
  
   fro day to day
  til he koude it by rote
  
   and thanne he song it wel and boldely
  
   fro word to word
