   and han wel founden by experience 
   that dremes been significaciouns 
  2980 as wel of joye as of tribulaciouns 
   that folk enduren in this lif present
  
   ther nedeth make of this noon argument
  
   the verray preeve sheweth it in dede
  
   
 oon of the gretteste auctour that men rede 
   seith thus
  that whilom two felawes wente 
   on pilgrimage
  in a ful good entente
  
   and happed so
  they coomen in a toun 
   wher as ther was swich congregacioun 
   of peple
  and eek so streit of herbergage
  
  2990 that they ne founde as muche as o cotage 
   in which they bothe myghte ylogged bee
  
   wherfore they mosten of necessitee
  
   as for that nyght
  departen compaignye
  
   and ech of hem gooth to his hostelrye
  
   and took his loggyng as it wolde falle
  
   that oon of hem was logged in a stalle
  
   fer in a yeerd
  with oxen of the plough
  
   that oother man was logged wel ynough
  
   as was his aventure or his fortune
  
  3000 that us governeth alle as in commune
  
   
 and so bifel that
  longe er it were day
  
   this man mette in his bed
  ther as he lay
  
   how that his felawe gan upon hym calle
  
   and seyde
   allas
  for in an oxes stalle 
   this nyght i shal be mordred ther i lye
  
   now help me
  deere brother
  or i dye
  
   in alle haste com to me
   he sayde
  
   this man out of his sleep for feere abrayde
  
   but whan that he was wakened of his sleep
  
  3010 he turned hym and took of this no keep
  
   hym thoughte his dreem nas but a vanitee
  
   thus twies in his slepyng dremed hee
  
   and atte thridde tyme yet his felawe 
   cam
  as hym thoughte
  and seide
   i am now slawe
  
   bihoold my bloody woundes depe and wyde
  
   arys up erly in the morwe tyde
  
   and at the west gate of the toun
   quod he
  
    a carte ful of dong ther shaltow se
  
   in which my body is hid ful prively
  
  3020 do thilke carte arresten boldely
  
   my gold caused my mordre
  sooth to sayn
   
   and tolde hym every point how he was slayn
  
   with a ful pitous face
  pale of hewe
  
   and truste wel
  his dreem he foond ful trewe
  
   for on the morwe
  as soone as it was day
  
   to his felawes in he took the way
  
   and whan that he cam to this oxes stalle
  
   after his felawe he bigan to calle
  
   
 the hostiler answerede hym anon
  
  3030 and seyde
   sire
  your felawe is agon
  
   as soone as day he wente out of the toun
   
   
 this man gan fallen in suspecioun
  
   remembrynge on his dremes that he mette
  
   and forth he gooth    no lenger wolde he lette    
   unto the west gate of the toun
  and fond 
   a dong carte
  wente as it were to donge lond
  
   that was arrayed in that same wise 
   as ye han herd the dede man devyse
  
   and with an hardy herte he gan to crye 
  3040 vengeance and justice of this felonye
  
    my felawe mordred is this same nyght
  
   and in this carte he lith gapyng upright
  
   i crye out on the ministres
   quod he
  
    that sholden kepe and reulen this citee
  
   harrow
  allas
  heere lith my felawe slayn
   
   what sholde i moore unto this tale sayn
  
   the peple out sterte and caste the cart to grounde
  
   and in the myddel of the dong they founde 
   the dede man
  that mordred was al newe
  
  3050 
 o blisful god
  that art so just and trewe
  
   lo
  how that thou biwreyest mordre alway
  
   mordre wol out
  that se we day by day
  
   mordre is so wlatsom and abhomynable 
   to god
  that is so just and resonable
  
   that he ne wol nat suffre it heled be
  
   though it abyde a yeer
  or two
  or thre
  
   mordre wol out
  this my conclusioun
  
   and right anon
  ministres of that toun 
   han hent the carter and so soore hym pyned
  
  3060 and eek the hostiler so soore engyned
  
   that they biknewe hire wikkednesse anon
  
   and were anhanged by the nekke bon
  
   
 heere may men seen that dremes been to drede
  
   and certes in the same book i rede
  
   right in the nexte chapitre after this    
   i gabbe nat
  so have i joye or blis    
   two men that wolde han passed over see
  
   for certeyn cause
  into a fer contree
  
   if that the wynd ne hadde been contrarie
  
  3070 that made hem in a citee for to tarie 
   that stood ful myrie upon an haven syde
  
   but on a day
  agayn the even tyde
  
   the wynd gan chaunge
  and blew right as hem leste
  
   jolif and glad they wente unto hir reste
  
   and casten hem ful erly for to saille
  
   but herkneth
  to that o man fil a greet mervaille
  
   that oon of hem
  in slepyng as he lay
  
   hym mette a wonder dreem agayn the day
  
   hym thoughte a man stood by his beddes syde
  
  3080 and hym comanded that he sholde abyde
  
   and seyde hym thus
   if thou tomorwe wende
  
   thow shalt be dreynt
  my tale is at an ende
   
   he wook
  and tolde his felawe what he mette
  
   and preyde hym his viage for to lette
  
   as for that day
  he preyde hym to byde
  
   his felawe
  that lay by his beddes syde
  
   gan for to laughe
  and scorned him ful faste
  
    no dreem
   quod he
   may so myn herte agaste 
   that i wol lette for to do my thynges
  
  3090 i sette nat a straw by thy dremynges
  
   for swevenes been but vanytees and japes
  
   men dreme alday of owles and of apes
  
   and of many a maze therwithal
  
   men dreme of thyng that nevere was ne shal
  
   but sith i see that thou wolt heere abyde
  
   and thus forslewthen wilfully thy tyde
  
   god woot
  it reweth me
  and have good day
   
   and thus he took his leve
  and wente his way
  
   but er that he hadde half his cours yseyled
  
  3100 noot i nat why
  ne what myschaunce it eyled
  
   but casuelly the shippes botme rente
  
   and ship and man under the water wente 
   in sighte of othere shippes it bisyde
  
   that with hem seyled at the same tyde
  
   and therfore
  faire pertelote so deere
  
   by swiche ensamples olde maistow leere 
   that no man sholde been to recchelees 
   of dremes
  for i seye thee
  doutelees
  
   that many a dreem ful soore is for to drede
  
  3110
