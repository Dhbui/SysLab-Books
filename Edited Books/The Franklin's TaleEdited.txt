  730 ther was a knyght that loved and dide his payne 
   to serve a lady in his beste wise
  
   and many a labour
  many a greet emprise
  
   he for his lady wroghte er she were wonne
  
   for she was oon the faireste under sonne
  
   and eek therto comen of so heigh kynrede 
   that wel unnethes dorste this knyght
  for drede
  
   telle hire his wo
  his peyne
  and his distresse
  
   but atte laste she
  for his worthynesse
  
   and namely for his meke obeysaunce
  
  740 hath swich a pitee caught of his penaunce 
   that pryvely she fil of his accord 
   to take hym for hir housbonde and hir lord
  
   of swich lordshipe as men han over hir wyves
  
   and for to lede the moore in blisse hir lyves
  
   of his free wyl he swoor hire as a knyght 
   that nevere in al his lyf he
  day ne nyght
  
   ne sholde upon hym take no maistrie 
   agayn hir wyl
  ne kithe hire jalousie
  
   but hire obeye
  and folwe hir wyl in al
  
  750 as any lovere to his lady shal
  
   save that the name of soveraynetee
  
   that wolde he have for shame of his degree
  
   she thanked hym
  and with ful greet humblesse 
   she seyde
  
 sire
  sith of youre gentillesse 
   ye profre me to have so large a reyne
  
   ne wolde nevere god bitwixe us tweyne
  
   as in my gilt

   sire
  i wol be youre humble trewe wyf    
   have heer my trouthe    til that myn herte breste
 
  
  760 thus been they bothe in quiete and in reste
  
   for o thyng
  sires
  saufly dar i seye
  
   that freendes everych oother moot obeye
  
   if they wol longe holden compaignye
  
   love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye
  
   whan maistrie comth
  the god of love anon 
   beteth his wynges
  and farewel
  he is gon
  
   love is a thyng as any spirit free
  
   wommen
  of kynde
  desiren libertee
  
   and nat to been constreyned as a thral
  
  770 and so doon men
  if i sooth seyen shal
  
   looke who that is moost pacient in love
  
   he is at his avantage al above
  
   pacience is an heigh vertu
  certeyn
  
   for it venquysseth
  as thise clerkes seyn
  
   thynges that rigour sholde nevere atteyne
  
   for every word men may nat chide or pleyne
  
   lerneth to suffre
  or elles
  so moot i goon
  
   ye shul it lerne
  wher so ye wole or noon
  
   for in this world
  certein
  ther no wight is 
  780 that he ne dooth or seith somtyme amys
  
   ire
  siknesse
  or constellacioun
  
   wyn
  wo
  or chaungynge of complexioun 
   causeth ful ofte to doon amys or speken
  
   on every wrong a man may nat be wreken
  
   after the tyme moste be temperaunce 
   to every wight that kan on governaunce
  
   and therfore hath this wise
  worthy knyght
  
   to lyve in ese
  suffrance hire bihight
  
   and she to hym ful wisly gan to swere 
  790 that nevere sholde ther be defaute in here
  
   heere may men seen an humble
  wys accord
  
   thus hath she take hir servant and hir lord    
   servant in love
  and lord in mariage
  
   thanne was he bothe in lordshipe and servage
  
   servage
  nay
  but in lordshipe above
  
   sith he hath bothe his lady and his love
  
   his lady
  certes
  and his wyf also
  
   the which that lawe of love acordeth to
  
   and whan he was in this prosperitee
  
  800 hoom with his wyf he gooth to his contree
  
   nat fer fro pedmark
  ther his dwellyng was
  
   where as he lyveth in blisse and in solas
  
   who koude telle
  but he hadde wedded be
  
   the joye
  the ese
  and the prosperitee 
   that is bitwixe an housbonde and his wyf
  
   a yeer and moore lasted this blisful lyf
  
   til that the knyght of which i speke of thus
  
   that of kayrrud was cleped arveragus
  
   shoop hym to goon and dwelle a yeer or tweyne 
  810 in engelond
  that cleped was eek briteyne
  
   to seke in armes worshipe and honour    
   for al his lust he sette in swich labour    
   and dwelled there two yeer
  the book seith thus
  
   now wol i stynten of this arveragus
  
   and speken i wole of dorigen his wyf
  
   that loveth hire housbonde as hire hertes lyf
  
   for his absence wepeth she and siketh
  
   as doon thise noble wyves whan hem liketh
  
   she moorneth
  waketh
  wayleth
  fasteth
  pleyneth
  
  820 desir of his presence hire so destreyneth 
   that al this wyde world she sette at noght
  
   hire freendes
  whiche that knewe hir hevy thoght
  
   conforten hire in al that ever they may
  
   they prechen hire
  they telle hire nyght and day 
   that causelees she sleeth hirself
  allas
  
   and every confort possible in this cas 
   they doon to hire with al hire bisynesse
  
   al for to make hire leve hire hevynesse
  
   by proces
  as ye knowen everichoon
  
  830 men may so longe graven in a stoon 
   til som figure therinne emprented be
  
   so longe han they conforted hire til she 
   receyved hath
  by hope and by resoun
  
   the emprentyng of hire consolacioun
  
   thurgh which hir grete sorwe gan aswage
  
   she may nat alwey duren in swich rage
  
   and eek arveragus
  in al this care
  
   hath sent hire lettres hoom of his welfare
  
   and that he wol come hastily agayn
  
  840 or elles hadde this sorwe hir herte slayn
  
   hire freendes sawe hir sorwe gan to slake 
   and preyde hire on knees
  for goddes sake
  
   to come and romen hire in compaignye
  
   awey to dryve hire derke fantasye
  
   and finally she graunted that requeste
  
   for wel she saugh that it was for the beste
  
   now stood hire castel faste by the see
  
   and often with hire freendes walketh shee 
   hire to disporte upon the bank an heigh
  
  850 where as she many a ship and barge seigh 
   seillynge hir cours
  where as hem liste go
  
   but thanne was that a parcel of hire wo
  
   for to hirself ful ofte
  
 allas
 
  seith she
  
   
 is ther no ship
  of so manye as i se
  
   wol bryngen hom my lord
  thanne were myn herte 
   al warisshed of his bittre peynes smerte
 
  
   another tyme ther wolde she sitte and thynke
  
   and caste hir eyen dounward fro the brynke
  
   but whan she saugh the grisly rokkes blake
  
  860 for verray feere so wolde hir herte quake 
   that on hire feet she myghte hire noght sustene
  
   thanne wolde she sitte adoun upon the grene
  
   and pitously into the see biholde
  
   and seyn right thus
  with sorweful sikes colde
  
   
 eterne god
  that thurgh thy purveiaunce 
   ledest the world by certein governaunce
  
   in ydel
  as men seyn
  ye no thyng make
  
   but
  lord
  thise grisly feendly rokkes blake
  
   that semen rather a foul confusion 
  870 of werk than any fair creacion 
   of swich a parfit wys god and a stable
  
   why han ye wroght this werk unresonable
  
   for by this werk
  south
  north
  ne west
  ne eest
  
   ther nys yfostred man
  ne bryd
  ne beest
  
   it dooth no good
  to my wit
  but anoyeth
  
   se ye nat
  lord
  how mankynde it destroyeth
  
   an hundred thousand bodyes of mankynde 
   han rokkes slayn
  al be they nat in mynde
  
   which mankynde is so fair part of thy werk 
  880 that thou it madest lyk to thyn owene merk
  
   thanne semed it ye hadde a greet chiertee 
   toward mankynde
  but how thanne may it bee 
   that ye swiche meenes make it to destroyen
  
   whiche meenes do no good
  but evere anoyen
  
   i woot wel clerkes wol seyn as hem leste
  
   by argumentz
  that al is for the beste
  
   though i ne kan the causes nat yknowe
  
   but thilke god that made wynd to blowe 
   as kepe my lord
  this my conclusion
  
  890 to clerkes lete i al disputison
  
   but wolde god that alle thise rokkes blake 
   were sonken into helle for his sake
  
   thise rokkes sleen myn herte for the feere
 
  
   thus wolde she seyn
  with many a pitous teere
  
   hire freendes sawe that it was no disport 
   to romen by the see
  but disconfort
  
   and shopen for to pleyen somwher elles
  
   they leden hire by ryveres and by welles
  
   and eek in othere places delitables
  
  900 they dauncen and they pleyen at ches and tables
  
   so on a day
  right in the morwe tyde
  
   unto a gardyn that was ther bisyde
  
   in which that they hadde maad hir ordinaunce 
   of vitaille and of oother purveiaunce
  
   they goon and pleye hem al the longe day
  
   and this was on the sixte morwe of may
  
   which may hadde peynted with his softe shoures 
   this gardyn ful of leves and of floures
  
   and craft of mannes hand so curiously 
  910 arrayed hadde this gardyn
  trewely
  
   that nevere was ther gardyn of swich prys 
   but if it were the verray paradys
  
   the odour of floures and the fresshe sighte 
   wolde han maked any herte lighte 
   that evere was born
  but if to greet siknesse 
   or to greet sorwe helde it in distresse
  
   so ful it was of beautee with plesaunce
  
   at after dyner gonne they to daunce
  
   and synge also
  save dorigen allone
  
  920 which made alwey hir compleint and hir moone
  
   for she ne saugh hym on the daunce go 
   that was hir housbonde and hir love also
  
   but nathelees she moste a tyme abyde 
   and with good hope lete hir sorwe slyde
  
   upon this daunce
  amonges othere men
  
   daunced a squier biforn dorigen
  
   that fressher was and jolyer of array
  
   as to my doom
  than is the month of may
  
   he syngeth
  daunceth
  passynge any man 
  930 that is
  or was
  sith that the world bigan
  
   therwith he was
  if men sholde hym discryve
  
   oon of the beste farynge man on lyve
  
   yong
  strong
  right vertuous
  and riche
  and wys
  
   and wel biloved
  and holden in greet prys
  
   and shortly
  if the sothe i tellen shal
  
   unwityng of this dorigen at al
  
   this lusty squier
  servant to venus
  
   which that ycleped was aurelius
  
   hadde loved hire best of any creature 
  940 two yeer and moore
  as was his aventure
  
   but nevere dorste he tellen hire his grevaunce
  
   withouten coppe he drank al his penaunce
  
   he was despeyred
  no thyng dorste he seye
  
   save in his songes somwhat wolde he wreye 
   his wo
  as in a general compleynyng
  
   he seyde he lovede and was biloved no thyng
  
   of swich matere made he manye layes
  
   songes
  compleintes
  roundels
  virelayes
  
   how that he dorste nat his sorwe telle
  
  950 but langwissheth as a furye dooth in helle
  
   and dye he moste
  he seyde
  as dide ekko 
   for narcisus
  that dorste nat telle hir wo
  
   in oother manere than ye heere me seye
  
   ne dorste he nat to hire his wo biwreye
  
   save that
  paraventure
  somtyme at daunces
  
   ther yonge folk kepen hir observaunces
  
   it may wel be he looked on hir face 
   in swich a wise as man that asketh grace
  
   but nothyng wiste she of his entente
  
  960 nathelees it happed
  er they thennes wente
  
   by cause that he was hire neighebour
  
   and was a man of worshipe and honour
  
   and hadde yknowen hym of tyme yoore
  
   they fille in speche
  and forth
  moore and moore
  
   unto his purpos drough aurelius
  
   and whan he saugh his tyme
  he seyde thus
  
   
 madame
 
  quod he

   so that i wiste it myghte youre herte glade
  
   i wolde that day that youre arveragus

   for with a word ye may me sleen or save
  
   heere at youre feet god wolde that i were grave
  
   i ne have as now no leyser moore to seye

   she gan to looke upon aurelius
  
  980 
 is this youre wyl
 
  quod she
  
 and sey ye thus
  
   nevere erst
 
  quod she

   taak this for fynal answere as of me
 
  
   but after that in pley thus seyde she

  quod she

  990 yet wolde i graunte yow to been youre love
  
   syn i yow se so pitously complayne

   of rokkes that ther nys no stoon ysene
  
   thanne wol i love yow best of any man
  
   have heer my trouthe

  quod he

   for to go love another mannes wyf
  
   that hath hir body whan so that hym liketh

   and with that word he turned hym anon
  
   tho coome hir othere freendes many oon
  
   and in the aleyes romeden up and doun
  
   and nothyng wiste of this conclusioun
  
   but sodeynly bigonne revel newe 
   til that the brighte sonne loste his hewe
  
   for th  orisonte hath reft the sonne his lyght    
   this is as muche to seye as it was nyght

   wherfore
  lord phebus
  this is my requeste    
   do this miracle
  or do myn herte breste    
   that now next at this opposicion 
   which in the signe shal be of the leon

  preyeth your suster that she go 
   no faster cours than ye thise yeres two
  
   thanne shal she been evene atte fulle alway

   to graunte me my sovereyn lady deere
  
   prey hire to synken every rok adoun

   thy temple in delphos wol i barefoot seke
  
   lord phebus
  se the teeris on my cheke
  
   and of my peyne have som compassioun
 
  
  1080 and with that word in swowne he fil adoun
  
   and longe tyme he lay forth in a traunce
  
   his brother
  which that knew of his penaunce
  
   up caughte hym and to bedde he hath hym broght
  
   dispeyred in this torment and this thoght 
   lete i this woful creature lye
  
   chese he
  for me
  wheither he wol lyve or dye
  
   arveragus
  with heele and greet honour
  
   as he that was of chivalrie the flour
  
   is comen hoom
  and othere worthy men
  
  1090 o blisful artow now
  thou dorigen
  
   that hast thy lusty housbonde in thyne armes
  
   the fresshe knyght
  the worthy man of armes
  
   that loveth thee as his owene hertes lyf
  
   no thyng list hym to been ymaginatyf
  
   if any wight hadde spoke
  whil he was oute
  
   to hire of love
  he hadde of it no doute
  
   he noght entendeth to no swich mateere
  
   but daunceth
  justeth
  maketh hire good cheere
  
   and thus in joye and blisse i lete hem dwelle
  
  1100 and of the sike aurelius wol i telle
  
   in langour and in torment furyus 
   two yeer and moore lay wrecche aurelyus
  
   er any foot he myghte on erthe gon
  
   ne confort in this tyme hadde he noon
  
   save of his brother
  which that was a clerk
  
   he knew of al this wo and al this werk
  
   for to noon oother creature
  certeyn
  
   of this matere he dorste no word seyn
  
   under his brest he baar it moore secree 
  1110 than evere dide pamphilus for galathee
  
   his brest was hool
  withoute for to sene
  
   but in his herte ay was the arwe kene
  
   and wel ye knowe that of a sursanure 
   in surgerye is perilous the cure
  
   but men myghte touche the arwe or come therby
  
   his brother weep and wayled pryvely
  
   til atte laste hym fil in remembraunce
  
   that whiles he was at orliens in fraunce    
   as yonge clerkes that been lykerous 
  1120 to reden artes that been curious 
   seken in every halke and every herne 
   particuler sciences for to lerne    
   he hym remembred that
  upon a day
  
   at orliens in studie a book he say 
   of magyk natureel
  which his felawe
  
   that was that tyme a bacheler of lawe
  
   al were he ther to lerne another craft
  
   hadde prively upon his desk ylaft
  
   which book spak muchel of the operaciouns 
  1130 touchynge the eighte and twenty mansiouns 
   that longen to the moone
  and swich folye 
   as in oure dayes is nat worth a flye    
   for hooly chirches feith in oure bileve 
   ne suffreth noon illusioun us to greve
  
   and whan this book was in his remembraunce
  
   anon for joye his herte gan to daunce
  
   and to hymself he seyde pryvely
  
   
 my brother shal be warisshed hastily
  
   for i am siker that ther be sciences 
  1140 by whiche men make diverse apparences
  
   swiche as thise subtile tregetoures pleye
  
   for ofte at feestes have i wel herd seye 
   that tregetours withinne an halle large 
   have maad come in a water and a barge
  
   and in the halle rowen up and doun
  
   somtyme hath semed come a grym leoun
  
   and somtyme floures sprynge as in a mede
  
   somtyme a vyne
  and grapes white and rede
  
   somtyme a castel
  al of lym and stoon
  
  1150 and whan hem lyked
  voyded it anon
  
   thus semed it to every mannes sighte
  
   
 now thanne conclude i thus
  that if i myghte 
   at orliens som oold felawe yfynde 
   that hadde thise moones mansions in mynde

   on whiche they wolden doon hir lecherye
  
   but was ther noon of al that compaignye 
   that she nas slayn
  and with a good entente 
   chees rather for to dye than assente 
   to been oppressed of hir maydenhede
  
   why sholde i thanne to dye been in drede
  
   lo

   that loved a mayden

   whan that hir fader slayn was on a nyght
  
  1390 unto dianes temple goth she right

   fro which ymage wolde she nevere go
  
   no wight ne myghte hir handes of it arace

   wel oghte a wyf rather hirselven slee

 what sholde i mo ensamples heerof sayn
  
  1420 sith that so manye han hemselven slayn 
   wel rather than they wolde defouled be
  
   i wol conclude that it is bet for me
