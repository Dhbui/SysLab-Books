       perform what desperate enterprise i will
  
       i ll have them fly to india for gold
  
       ransack the ocean for orient pearl
  
       and search all corners of the new found world 
       for pleasant fruits and princely delicates
  
       i ll have them read me strange philosophy
  
       and tell the secrets of all foreign kings
  
       i ll have them wall all germany with brass
  
       and make swift rhine circle fair wertenberg

  27  
       wherewith the students shall be bravely clad
  
       i ll levy soldiers with the coin they bring
  
       and chase the prince of parma from our land

       come
  german valdes
  and cornelius
  
       and make me blest with your sage conference
  
       valdes
  sweet valdes
  and cornelius
  
       know that your words have won me at the last 
       to practice magic and concealed arts
  
       yet not your words only
  30  but mine own fantasy
  
       that will receive no object
  for my head 
       but ruminates on necromantic skill
  
       philosophy is odious and obscure
  
       both law and physic are for petty wits
  
       divinity is basest of the three
  
       unpleasant
  harsh
  contemptible
  and vile
  31  
        tis magic
  magic
  that hath ravish d me
  
       then
  gentle friends
  aid me in this attempt
  
       and i
  that have with concise syllogisms 32  
       gravell d the pastors of the german church
  
       and made the flowering pride of wertenberg 
       swarm to my problems
  as the infernal spirits 
       on sweet musaeus when he came to hell
  
       will be as cunning 33  as agrippa 34  was
  
       whose shadow 35  made all europe honour him
  
   
       valdes
  faustus
  these books
  thy wit
  and our experience
  
       shall make all nations to canonize us
  
       as indian moors obey their spanish lords
  
       so shall the spirits 36  of every element 
       be always serviceable to us three
  
       like lions shall they guard us when we please
  
       like almain rutters 37  with their horsemen s staves
  
       or lapland giants
  trotting by our sides
  
       sometimes like women
  or unwedded maids
  
       shadowing more beauty in their airy brows 
       than have the 38  white breasts of the queen of love
  
       from 39  venice shall they drag huge argosies
  
       and from america the golden fleece 
       that yearly stuffs old philip s treasury
  
       if learned faustus will be resolute
  
   
       faustus
  valdes
  as resolute am i in this 
       as thou to live
   therefore object it not
  
   
       cornelius
  the miracles that magic will perform 
       will make thee vow to study nothing else
  
       he that is grounded in astrology
  
       enrich d with tongues
  well seen in 40  minerals
  
       hath all the principles magic doth require
  
       then doubt not
  faustus
  but to be renowm d
  41  
       and more frequented for this mystery 
       than heretofore the delphian oracle
  
       the spirits tell me they can dry the sea
  
       and fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks
  
       ay
  all the wealth that our forefathers hid 
       within the massy entrails of the earth
  
       then tell me
  faustus
  what shall we three want
  
   
       faustus
  nothing
  cornelius
   o
  this cheers my soul
  
       come
  shew me some demonstrations magical
  
       that i may conjure in some lusty grove
  
       and have these joys in full possession
  
   
       valdes
  then haste thee to some solitary grove
  
       and bear wise bacon s and albertus  42  works
  
       the hebrew psalter
  and new testament
  
       and whatsoever else is requisite 
       we will inform thee ere our conference cease
  
   
       cornelius
  valdes
  first let him know the words of art
  
       and then
  all other ceremonies learn d
  
       faustus may try his cunning 43  by himself
  
   
       valdes
  first i ll instruct thee in the rudiments
  
       and then wilt thou be perfecter than i
  
   
       faustus
  then come and dine with me
  and
  after meat
  
       we ll canvass every quiddity thereof
  
       for
  ere i sleep
  i ll try what i can do
  
       this night i ll conjure
  though i die therefore
  
             exeunt
   
   
            enter two scholars
  44  
   
       first scholar
  i wonder what s become of faustus
  that was wont 
       to make our schools ring with sic probo
  
   
       second scholar
  that shall we know
  for see
  here comes his boy
  
   
            enter wagner
  
   
       first scholar
  how now
  sirrah
  where s thy master
  
   
       wagner
  god in heaven knows
  
   
       second scholar
  why
  dost not thou know
  
   
       wagner
  yes
  i know
  but that follows not
  
   
       first scholar
  go to
  sirrah
  leave your jesting
  and tell us 
       where he is
  
   
       wagner
  that follows not necessary by force of argument
  that you
  
       being licentiates
  should stand upon
  45   therefore acknowledge 
       your error
  and be attentive
  
   
       second scholar
  why
  didst thou not say thou knewest
  
   
       wagner
  have you any witness on t
  
   
       first scholar
  yes
  sirrah
  i heard you
  
   
       wagner
  ask my fellow if i be a thief
  
   
       second scholar
  well
  you will not tell us
  
   
       wagner
  yes
  sir
  i will tell you
   yet
  if you were not dunces
  
       you would never ask me such a question
  for is not he corpus 
       naturale
  and is not that mobile
  then wherefore should you 
       ask me such a question
   but that i am by nature phlegmatic
  
       slow to wrath
  and prone to lechery  to love
  i would say 
  
       it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place 
       of execution
  although i do not doubt to see you both hanged 
       the next sessions
   thus having triumphed over you
  i will set 
       my countenance like a precisian
  and begin to speak thus
    
       truly
  my dear brethren
  my master is within at dinner
  
       with valdes and cornelius
  as this wine
  if it could speak
  
       would 46  inform your worships
   and so
  the lord bless you
  
       preserve you
  and keep you
  my dear brethren
  my dear brethren
  47  
             exit
   
   
       first scholar
  nay
  then
  i fear he is fallen into that damned art 
       for which they two are infamous through the world
  
   
       second scholar
  were he a stranger
  and not allied to me
  yet should 
       i grieve for him
  but
  come
  let us go and inform the rector
  
       and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him
  
   
       first scholar
  o
  but i fear me nothing can reclaim him
  
   
       second scholar
  yet let us try what we can do
  
             exeunt
   
   
            enter faustus to conjure
  48  
   
       faustus
  now that the gloomy shadow of the earth
  
       longing to view orion s drizzling look
  
       leaps from th  antartic world unto the sky
  
       and dims the welkin with her pitchy breath
  
       faustus
  begin thine incantations
  
       and try if devils will obey thy hest
  
       seeing thou hast pray d and sacrific d to them
  
       within this circle is jehovah s name
  
       forward and backward anagrammatiz d
  49  
       th  abbreviated 50  names of holy saints
  
       figures of every adjunct to the heavens
  
       and characters of signs and erring 51  stars
  
       by which the spirits are enforc d to rise
  
       then fear not
  faustus
  but be resolute
  
       and try the uttermost magic can perform
    
       sint mihi dei acherontis propitii
   valeat numen triplex jehovoe
  
       ignei
  aerii
  aquatani spiritus
  salvete
   orientis princeps 
       belzebub
  inferni ardentis monarcha
  et demogorgon
  propitiamus 
       vos
  ut appareat et surgat mephistophilis
  quod tumeraris
  52  
       per jehovam
  gehennam
  et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo
  
       signumque crucis quod nunc facio
  et per vota nostra
  ipse nunc 
       surgat nobis dicatus 53  mephistophilis
  
   
            enter mephistophilis
  
   
       i charge thee to return
  and change thy shape
  
       thou art too ugly to attend on me
  
       go
  and return an old franciscan friar
  
       that holy shape becomes a devil best
  
             exit mephistophilis
   
   
       i see there s virtue in my heavenly words
  
       who would not be proficient in this art
  
       how pliant is this mephistophilis
  
       full of obedience and humility
  
       such is the force of magic and my spells
  
       no
  faustus
  thou art conjuror laureat
  
       that canst command great mephistophilis
  
       quin regis mephistophilis fratris imagine
  
   
            re enter mephistophilis like a franciscan friar
  54  
   
       mephist
  now
  faustus
  what wouldst thou have me do
  
   
       faustus
  i charge thee wait upon me whilst i live
  
       to do whatever faustus shall command
  
       be it to make the moon drop from her sphere
  
       or the ocean to overwhelm the world
  
   
       mephist
  i am a servant to great lucifer
  
       and may not follow thee without his leave
  
       no more than he commands must we perform
  
   
       faustus
  did not he charge thee to appear to me
  
   
       mephist
  no
  i came hither 55  of mine own accord
  
   
       faustus
  did not my conjuring speeches raise thee
  speak
  
   
       mephist
  that was the cause
  but yet per accidens
  56  
       for
  when we hear one rack the name of god
  
       abjure the scriptures and his saviour christ
  
       we fly
  in hope to get his glorious soul
  
       nor will we come
  unless he use such means 
       whereby he is in danger to be damn d
  
       therefore the shortest cut for conjuring 
       is stoutly to abjure the trinity
  
       and pray devoutly to the prince of hell
  
   
       faustus
  so faustus hath 
       already done
  and holds this principle
  
       there is no chief but only belzebub
  
       to whom faustus doth dedicate himself
  
       this word 
 damnation
  terrifies not him
  
       for he confounds hell in elysium
  
       his ghost be with the old philosophers
  
       but
  leaving these vain trifles of men s souls
  
       tell me what is that lucifer thy lord
  
   
       mephist
  arch regent and commander of all spirits
  
   
       faustus
  was not that lucifer an angel once
  
   
       mephist
  yes
  faustus
  and most dearly lov d of god
  
   
       faustus
  how comes it
  then
  that he is prince of devils
  
   
       mephist
  o
  by aspiring pride and insolence
  
       for which god threw him from the face of heaven
  
   
       faustus

       having thee ever to attend on me
  
       to give me whatsoever i shall ask

       good angel
  o
  they are means to bring thee unto heaven
  
   
       evil angel

       why
  the signiory of embden shall be mine
  
       when mephistophilis shall stand by me
  
       what god can hurt thee
  faustus
  thou art safe 
       cast no more doubts
   come
  mephistophilis
  
       and bring glad tidings from great lucifer
    
       is t not midnight

  thy lord
  
   
       mephist
  that i shall wait on faustus whilst he lives
  78  
       so he will buy my service with his soul
  
   
       faustus
  already faustus hath hazarded that for thee
  
   
       mephist
  but
  faustus
  thou must bequeath it solemnly
  
       and write a deed of gift with thine own blood
  
       for that security craves great lucifer
  
       if thou deny it
  i will back to hell
  
   
       faustus
  stay
  mephistophilis
  and tell me
  what good will my soul 
       do thy lord
  
   
       mephist
  enlarge his kingdom
  
   
       faustus
  is that the reason why 79  he tempts us thus
  
   
       mephist
  solamen miseris socios habuisse doloris
  80  
   
       faustus
  why

  as great as have the human souls of men
  
       but
  tell me
  faustus
  shall i have thy soul
  
       and i will be thy slave
  and wait on thee
  
       and give thee more than thou hast wit to ask
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  mephistophilis

       mephist
  then
  faustus
  83  stab thine arm courageously
  
       and bind thy soul
  that at some certain day 
       great lucifer may claim it as his own
  
       and then be thou as great as lucifer
  
   
       faustus
   stabbing his arm  lo
  mephistophilis
  for love of thee
  
       i cut mine arm
  and with my proper blood 
       assure my soul to be great lucifer s
  
       chief lord and regent of perpetual night
  
       view here the blood that trickles from mine arm
  
       and let it be propitious for my wish
  
   
       mephist
  but
  faustus
  thou must 
       write it in manner of a deed of gift
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  so i will  writes 
   but
  mephistophilis
  
       my blood congeals
  and i can write no more
  
   
       mephist
  i ll fetch thee fire to dissolve it straight
  
             exit
   
   
       faustus
  what might the staying of my blood portend
  
       is it unwilling i should write this bill
  84  
       why streams it not
  that i may write afresh
  
       faustus gives to thee his soul
   ah
  there it stay d
  
       why shouldst thou not
  is not thy soul shine own
  
       then write again
  faustus gives to thee his soul
  
   
            re enter mephistophilis with a chafer of coals
  
   
       mephist

  now the blood begins to clear again
  
       now will i make an end immediately

       mephist

       faustus
  consummatum est
  this bill is ended
  
       and faustus hath bequeath d his soul to lucifer
  
       but what is this inscription 86  on mine arm
  
       homo
  fuge
   whither should i fly
  
       if unto god
  he ll throw me 87  down to hell
  
       my senses are deceiv d
  here s nothing writ
    
       i see it plain
  here in this place is writ
  
       homo
  fuge
   yet shall not faustus fly
  
   
       mephist
  i ll fetch him somewhat to delight his mind
  
             aside
  and then exit
   
   
            re enter mephistophilis with devils
  who give crowns 
            and rich apparel to faustus
  dance
  and then depart
  
   
       faustus
  speak
  mephistophilis
  what means this show
  
   
       mephist
  nothing
  faustus
  but to delight thy mind withal
  
       and to shew thee what magic can perform
  
   
       faustus
  but may i raise up spirits when i please
  
   
       mephist
  ay
  faustus
  and do greater things than these
  
   
       faustus
  then there s enough for a thousand souls
  
       here
  mephistophilis
  receive this scroll
  
       a deed of gift of body and of soul
  
       but yet conditionally that thou perform 
       all articles prescrib d between us both
  
   
       mephist
  faustus
  i swear by hell and lucifer 
       to effect all promises between us made
  
   
       faustus
  then hear me read them
    reads  on these conditions 
       following
   first
  that faustus may be a spirit in form and 
       substance
   secondly
  that mephistophilis shall be his servant
  
       and at his command
   thirdly
  that mephistophilis shall do for him
  
       and bring him whatsoever he desires
  88   fourthly
  that he shall 
       be in his chamber or house invisible
   lastly
  that he shall appear 
       to the said john faustus
  at all times

       soever he please
   i
  john faustus
  of wertenberg
  doctor
  by 
       these presents
  do give both body and soul to lucifer prince of 
       the east
  and his minister mephistophilis
  and furthermore grant 
       unto them
  that
  89  twenty four years being expired
  the articles 
       above written inviolate
  full power to fetch or carry the said 
       john faustus
  body and soul
  flesh
  blood
  or goods
  into their 
       habitation wheresoever
   by me
  john faustus
  
   
       mephist
  speak
  faustus
  do you deliver this as your deed
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  take it
  and the devil give thee good on t
  
   
       mephist
  now
  faustus
  ask what thou wilt
  
   
       faustus
  first will i question with thee about hell
  
       tell me
  where is the place that men call hell
  
   
       mephist
  under the heavens
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  but whereabout
  
   
       mephist
  within the bowels of these 90  elements
  
       where we are tortur d and remain for ever
  
       hell hath no limits
  nor is circumscrib d 
       in one self place
  for where we are is hell
  
       and where hell is
  there 91  must we ever be
  
       and
  to conclude
  when all the world dissolves
  
       and every creature shall be purified
  
       all places shall be hell that are 92  not heaven
  
   
       faustus
  come
  i think hell s a fable
  
   
       mephist
  ay
  think so still
  till experience change thy mind
  
   
       faustus
  why
  think st thou
  then
  that faustus shall be damn d
  
   
       mephist
  ay
  of necessity
  for here s the scroll 
       wherein thou hast given thy soul to lucifer
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  and body too
   but what of that
  
       think st thou that faustus is so fond 93  to imagine 
       that
  after this life
  there is any pain
  
       tush
  these are trifles and mere old wives  tales
  
   
       mephist
  but
  faustus
  i am an instance to prove the contrary
  
       for i am damn d
  and am now in hell
  
   
       faustus
  how
  now in hell
  
       nay
  an this be hell
  i ll willingly be damn d here
  
       what
  walking
  disputing
   c
  94  
       but
  leaving off this
  let me have a wife
  95  
       the fairest maid in germany
  
       for i am wanton and lascivious
  
       and cannot live without a wife
  
   
       mephist
  how
  a wife
  
       i prithee
  faustus
  talk not of a wife
  
   
       faustus
  nay
  sweet mephistophilis
  fetch me one
  for i will have 
       one
  
   
       mephist
  well
  thou wilt have one
   sit there till i come
   i ll 
       fetch thee a wife in the devil s name
  
             exit
   
   
            re enter mephistophilis with a devil drest like a woman
  
            with fire works
  
   
       mephist
  tell me
  96  faustus
  how dost thou like thy wife
  
   
       faustus
  a plague on her for a hot whore
  
   
       mephist
  tut
  faustus
  
       marriage is but a ceremonial toy
  
       if thou lovest me
  think no 97  more of it
  
       i ll cull thee out the fairest courtezans
  
       and bring them every morning to thy bed
  
       she whom thine eye shall like
  thy heart shall have
  
       be she as chaste as was penelope
  
       as wise as saba
  98  or as beautiful 
       as was bright lucifer before his fall
  
       hold
  take this book
  peruse it thoroughly
  
             gives book
   
   
       the iterating 99  of these lines brings gold
  
       the framing of this circle on the ground 
       brings whirlwinds
  tempests

       because thou hast depriv d me of those joys

  and knives
  
       poison
  guns
  halters
  and envenom d steel 
       are laid before me to despatch myself

       of alexander s love and oenon s death
  
       and hath not he
  that built the walls of thebes 
       with ravishing sound of his melodious harp

       why should i die

  let us dispute again
  
       and argue of divine astrology
  100  
       tell me
  are there many heavens above the moon 
       are all celestial bodies but one globe
  
       as is the substance of this centric earth
  
   
       mephist
  as are the elements
  such are the spheres
  
       mutually folded in each other s orb
  
       and

       all jointly move upon one axletree
  
       whose terminine is term d the world s wide pole

  mars
  or jupiter 
       feign d
  but are erring 101  stars
  
   
       faustus
  but
  tell me
  have they all one motion
  both situ et 
       tempore
  
   
       mephist
  all jointly move from east to west in twenty four hours 
       upon the poles of the world
  but differ in their motion upon 
       the poles of the zodiac
  
   
       faustus
  tush
  
       these slender trifles wagner can decide
  
       hath mephistophilis no greater skill
  
       who knows not the double motion of the planets
  
       the first is finish d in a natural day
  
       the second thus
  as saturn in thirty years
  jupiter in twelve
  
       mars in four
  the sun
  venus
  and mercury in a year
  the moon in 
       twenty eight days
   tush
  these are freshmen s 102  suppositions

  why have we not 
       conjunctions

  in some less

       evil angel
  if thou repent
  devils shall tear thee in pieces

       faustus
  nor will i henceforth
   pardon me in this
  
       and faustus vows never to look to heaven
  
       never to name god
  or to pray to him
  
       to burn his scriptures
  slay his ministers
  
       and make my spirits pull his churches down

       whose buildings fair and gorgeous to the eye

  in one night s space
  
       from thence to venice

       that make safe passage to each part of rome
  
       upon the bridge call d ponte 119  angelo

  131  faustus
  and a knight
  with attendants
  
   
       emperor
  master doctor faustus
  132  i have heard strange report 
       of thy knowledge in the black art
  how that none in my empire 
       nor in the whole world can compare with thee for the rare effects 
       of magic
   they say thou hast a familiar spirit
  by whom thou canst 
       accomplish what thou list
   this
  therefore
  is my request
  that 
       thou let me see some proof of thy skill
  that mine eyes may be 
       witnesses to confirm what mine ears have heard reported
   and here 
       i swear to thee
  by the honour of mine imperial crown
  that
  
       whatever thou doest
  thou shalt be no ways prejudiced or endamaged
  
   
       knight
  i faith
  he looks much like a conjurer
  
             aside
   
   
       faustus
  my gracious sovereign
  though i must confess myself far 
       inferior to the report men have published
  and nothing answerable 
       to the honour of your imperial majesty
  yet
  for that love and duty 
       binds me thereunto
  i am content to do whatsoever your majesty 
       shall command me
  
   
       emperor
  then
  doctor faustus
  mark what i shall say
  
       as i was sometime solitary set 
       within my closet
  sundry thoughts arose 
       about the honour of mine ancestors
  
       how they had won 133  by prowess such exploits
  
       got such riches
  subdu d so many kingdoms
  
       as we that do succeed
  134  or they that shall 
       hereafter possess our throne
  shall 
        i fear me  ne er attain to that degree 
       of high renown and great authority
  
       amongst which kings is alexander the great
  
       chief spectacle of the world s pre eminence
  
       the bright 135  shining of whose glorious acts 
       lightens the world with his reflecting beams
  
       as when i hear but motion made of him
  
       it grieves my soul i never saw the man
  
       if
  therefore
  thou
  by cunning of thine art
  
       canst raise this man from hollow vaults below
  
       where lies entomb d this famous conqueror
  
       and bring with him his beauteous paramour
  
       both in their right shapes
  gesture
  and attire 
       they us d to wear during their time of life
  
       thou shalt both satisfy my just desire
  
       and give me cause to praise thee whilst i live
  
   
       faustus
  my gracious lord
  i am ready to accomplish your request
  
       so far forth as by art and power of my spirit i am able to perform
  
   
       knight
  i faith
  that s just nothing at all
  
             aside
   
   
       faustus
  but
  if it like your grace
  it is not in my ability 136  
       to present before your eyes the true substantial bodies of those 
       two deceased princes
  which long since are consumed to dust
  
   
       knight
  ay

  master doctor
  now there s a sign of grace in 
       you
  when you will confess the truth
  
             aside
   
   
       faustus
  but such spirits as can lively resemble alexander and 
       his paramour shall appear before your grace
  in that manner that 
       they both 137  lived in
  in their most flourishing estate
  which 
       i doubt not shall sufficiently content your imperial majesty
  
   
       emperor

  master doctor
  let me see them presently
  
   
       knight
  do you hear
  master doctor

       paramour before the emperor
  
   
       faustus
  how then
  sir
  
   
       knight
  i faith
  that s as true as diana turned me to a stag

       you

  had a 
       wart or mole in her neck
   how shall i know whether it be so or no
  
   
       faustus
  your highness may boldly go and see
  
   
       emperor
  sure
  these are no spirits
  but the true substantial 
       bodies of those two deceased princes
  
             exeunt spirits
   
   
       faustus
  wilt please your highness now to send for the knight

       bred in the concave of some monstrous rock
  
       how dar st thou thus abuse a gentleman

  good master doctor
  at my entreaty release him
   he hath 
       done penance sufficient
  
   
       faustus
  my gracious lord
  not so much for the injury he offered 
       me here in your presence
  as to delight you with some mirth
  hath 
       faustus worthily requited this injurious knight
  which being all 
       i desire
  i am content to release him of his horns
   and

  my gracious lord
  i am glad it contents you so well
  
         but it may be
  madam

  and you shall have it
  
   
       duchess
  thanks
  good master doctor
   and

       intent to pleasure me
  i will not hide from you the thing my heart 
       desires

       of ripe grapes

       duke
  believe me
  master doctor
  this makes me wonder above the 
       rest
  that being in the dead time of winter and in the month of 
       january
  how you should come by these grapes
  
   
       faustus
  if it like your grace
  the year is divided into two 
       circles over the whole world
  that
  when it is here winter with 
       us
  in the contrary circle it is summer with them
  as in india
  
       saba
  149  and farther countries in the east
  and by means of a 
       swift spirit that i have
  i had them brought hither
  as you see
  
         how do you like them
  madam

  151  
   
       wagner
  i think my master means to die shortly
  
       for he hath given to me all his goods
  152  
       and yet
  methinks
  if that death were near
  
       he would not banquet
  and carouse
  and swill 
       amongst the students
  as even now he doth
  
       who are at supper with such belly cheer 
       as wagner ne er beheld in all his life
  
       see
  where they come
  belike the feast is ended
  
             exit
   
   
            enter faustus with two or three scholars
  and mephistophilis
  
   
       first scholar
  master doctor faustus
  since our conference about 
       fair ladies
  which was the beautifulest in all the world
  we have 
       determined with ourselves that helen of greece was the admirablest 
       lady that ever lived
   therefore
  master doctor
  if you will do us 
       that favour
  as to let us see that peerless dame of greece
  whom 
       all the world admires for majesty
  we should think ourselves much 
       beholding unto you
  
   
       faustus
  gentlemen
  
       for that i know your friendship is unfeign d
  
       and faustus  custom is not to deny 
       the just requests of those that wish him well
  
       you shall behold that peerless dame of greece
  
       no otherways for pomp and majesty 
       than when sir paris cross d the seas with her
  
       and brought the spoils to rich dardania
  
       be silent
  then
  for danger is in words
  
             music sounds
  and helen passeth over the stage
  153   
   
       second scholar
  too simple is my wit to tell her praise
  
       whom all the world admires for majesty
  
   
       third scholar
  no marvel though the angry greeks pursu d 
       with ten years  war the rape of such a queen
  
       whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare
  
   
       first scholar
  since we have seen the pride of nature s works
  
       and only paragon of excellence
  
       let us depart
  and for this glorious deed 
       happy and blest be faustus evermore
  
   
       faustus
  gentlemen
  farewell
   the same i wish to you
  
             exeunt scholars
   
   
            enter an old man
  154  
   
       old man
  ah
  doctor faustus
  that i might prevail 
       to guide thy steps unto the way of life
  
       by which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal 
       that shall conduct thee to celestial rest
  
       break heart
  drop blood
  and mingle it with tears
  
       tears falling from repentant heaviness 
       of thy most vile 155  and loathsome filthiness
  
       the stench whereof corrupts the inward soul 
       with such flagitious crimes of heinous sin 156  
       as no commiseration may expel
  
       but mercy
  faustus
  of thy saviour sweet
  
       whose blood alone must wash away thy guilt
  
   
       faustus
  where art thou
  faustus
  wretch
  what hast thou done
  
       damn d art thou
  faustus
  damn d
  despair and die
  
       hell calls for right
  and with a roaring voice 
       says
  
 faustus
  come
  thine hour is almost 157  come
 
  
       and faustus now 158  will come to do thee right
  
             mephistophilis gives him a dagger
   
   
       old man
  ah
  stay
  good faustus
  stay thy desperate steps
  
       i see an angel hovers o er thy head
  
       and
  with a vial full of precious grace
  
       offers to pour the same into thy soul
  
       then call for mercy
  and avoid despair
  
   
       faustus
  ah
  my sweet friend
  i feel 
       thy words to comfort my distressed soul
  
       leave me a while to ponder on my sins
  
   
       old man
  i go
  sweet faustus
  but with heavy cheer
  
       fearing the ruin of thy hopeless soul
  
             exit
   
   
       faustus
  accursed faustus
  where is mercy now
  
       i do repent
  and yet i do despair
  
       hell strives with grace for conquest in my breast
  
       what shall i do to shun the snares of death
  
   
       mephist
  thou traitor
  faustus
  i arrest thy soul 
       for disobedience to my sovereign lord
  
       revolt
  or i ll in piece meal tear thy flesh
  
   
       faustus
  sweet mephistophilis
  entreat thy lord 
       to pardon my unjust presumption
  
       and with my blood again i will confirm 
       my former vow i made to lucifer
  
   
       mephist
  do it
  then
  quickly
  159  with unfeigned heart
  
       lest greater danger do attend thy drift
  
   
       faustus
  torment
  sweet friend
  that base and crooked age
  
       that durst dissuade me from thy lucifer
  
       with greatest torments that our hell affords
  
   
       mephist
  his faith is great
  i cannot touch his soul
  
       but what i may afflict his body with 
       i will attempt
  which is but little worth
  
   
       faustus
  one thing
  good servant
  160  let me crave of thee
  
       to glut the longing of my heart s desire
    
       that i might have unto my paramour 
       that heavenly helen which i saw of late
  
       whose sweet embracings may extinguish clean 
       those 161  thoughts that do dissuade me from my vow
  
       and keep mine oath i made to lucifer
  
   
       mephist
  faustus
  this
  162  or what else thou shalt desire
  
       shall be perform d in twinkling of an eye
  
   
            re enter helen
  
   
       faustus
  was this the face that launch d a thousand ships
  
       and burnt the topless 163  towers of ilium   
       sweet helen
  make me immortal with a kiss
    
             kisses her
   
       her lips suck forth my soul
   see
  where it flies
    
       come
  helen
  come
  give me my soul again
  
       here will i dwell
  for heaven is 164  in these lips
  
       and all is dross that is not helena
  
       i will be paris
  and for love of thee
  
       instead of troy
  shall wertenberg be sack d
  
       and i will combat with weak menelaus
  
       and wear thy colours on my plumed crest
  
       yea
  i will wound achilles in the heel
  
       and then return to helen for a kiss
  
       o
  thou art fairer than the evening air 
       clad in the beauty of a thousand stars
  
       brighter art thou than flaming jupiter 
       when he appear d to hapless semele
  
       more lovely than the monarch of the sky 
       in wanton arethusa s azur d arms
  
       and none but thou shalt 165  be my paramour
  
             exeunt
   
   
            enter the old man
  166  
   
       old man
  accursed faustus
  miserable man
  
       that from thy soul exclud st the grace of heaven
  
       and fly st the throne of his tribunal seat
  
   
            enter devils
  
   
       satan begins to sift me with his pride
  
       as in this furnace god shall try my faith
  
       my faith
  vile hell
  shall triumph over thee
  
       ambitious fiends
  see how the heavens smile 
       at your repulse
  and laugh your state to scorn
  
       hence
  hell
  for hence i fly unto my god
  
             exeunt
   on one side
  devils
  on the other
  old man
   
   
            enter faustus
  167  with scholars
  
   
       faustus
  ah

       first scholar
  what ails faustus
  
   
       faustus
  ah
  my sweet chamber fellow
  had i lived with thee
  
       then had i lived still
  but now i die eternally
   look
  comes 
       he not
  comes he not
  
   
       second scholar
  what means faustus
  
   
       third scholar
  belike he is grown into some sickness by being 
       over solitary
  
   
       first scholar
  if it be so
  we ll have physicians to cure him
  
          tis but a surfeit
  never fear
  man
  
   
       faustus
  a surfeit of deadly sin
  that hath damned both body 
       and soul
  
   
       second scholar
  yet
  faustus
  look up to heaven
  remember god s 
       mercies are infinite
  
   
       faustus
  but faustus  offence can ne er be pardoned
   the serpent 
       that tempted eve may be saved
  but not faustus
   ah
  gentlemen
  
       hear me with patience
  and tremble not at my speeches
   though 
       my heart pants and quivers to remember that i have been a student 
       here these thirty years
  o
  would i had never seen wertenberg
  
       never read book
  and what wonders i have done
  all germany can 
       witness
  yea
  all the world
  for which faustus hath lost both 
       germany and the world
  yea
  heaven itself
  heaven
  the seat of 
       god
  the throne of the blessed
  the kingdom of joy
  and must 
       remain in hell for ever
  hell
  ah
  hell
  for ever
   sweet friends
  
       what shall become of faustus
  being in hell for ever
  
   
       third scholar
  yet
  faustus
  call on god
  
   
       faustus
  on god
  whom faustus hath abjured
  on god
  whom faustus 
       hath blasphemed
   ah
  my god
  i would weep
  but the devil draws in 
       my tears
   gush forth blood
  instead of tears
  yea
  life and soul
  
       o
  he stays my tongue
   i would lift up my hands
  but see
  they 
       hold them
  they hold them
  
   
       all
  who
  faustus
  
   
       faustus
  lucifer and mephistophilis
   ah
  gentlemen
  i gave them 
       my soul for my cunning
  168  
   
       all
  god forbid
  
   
       faustus
  god forbade it
  indeed
  but faustus hath done it
   for 
       vain pleasure of twenty four years hath faustus lost eternal joy 
       and felicity
   i writ them a bill with mine own blood
   the date 
       is expired
  the time will come
  and he will fetch me
  
   
       first scholar
  why did not faustus tell us of this before
  169  
       that divines might have prayed for thee
  
   
       faustus
  oft have i thought to have done so
  but the devil 
       threatened to tear me in pieces
  if i named god
  to fetch both 
       body and soul
  if i once gave ear to divinity
   and now  tis too 
       late
   gentlemen
  away
  lest you perish with me
  
   
       second scholar
  o
  what shall we do to save 170  faustus
  
   
       faustus
  talk not of me
  but save yourselves
  and depart
  
   
       third scholar
  god will strengthen me
  i will stay with faustus
  
   
       first scholar
  tempt not god
  sweet friend
  but let us into the 
       next room
  and there pray for him
  
   
       faustus
  ay
  pray for me
  pray for me
  and what noise soever 
       ye hear
  171  come not unto me
  for nothing can rescue me
  
   
       second scholar
  pray thou
  and we will pray that god may have 
       mercy upon thee
  
   
       faustus
  gentlemen
  farewell
   if i live till morning
  i ll visit 
       you
  if not
  faustus is gone to hell
  
   
       all
  faustus
  farewell
  
             exeunt scholars
   the clock strikes eleven
   
   
       faustus
  ah
  faustus
  
       now hast thou but one bare hour to live
  
       and then thou must be damn d perpetually
  
       stand still
  you ever moving spheres of heaven
  
       that time may cease
  and midnight never come
  
       fair nature s eye
  rise
  rise again
  and make 
       perpetual day
  or let this hour be but 
       a year
  a month
  a week
  a natural day
  
       that faustus may repent and save his soul
  
       o lente
  172  lente currite
  noctis equi
  
       the stars move still
  time runs
  the clock will strike
  
       the devil will come
  and faustus must be damn d
  
       o
  i ll leap up to my god
   who pulls me down
    
       see
  see
  where christ s blood streams in the firmament
  
       one drop would save my soul
  half a drop
   ah
  my christ
    
       ah
  rend not my heart for naming of my christ
  
       yet will i call on him
   o
  spare me
  lucifer
    
       where is it now
   tis gone
   and see
  where god 
       stretcheth out his arm
  and bends his ireful brows
  
       mountains and hills
  come
  come
  and fall on me
  
       and hide me from the heavy wrath of god
  
       no
  no
  
       then will i headlong run into the earth
  
       earth
  gape
   o
  no
  it will not harbour me
  
       you stars that reign d at my nativity
  
       whose influence hath allotted death and hell
  
       now draw up faustus
  like a foggy mist
  
       into the entrails of yon labouring cloud s 
  
       that
  when you 173  vomit forth into the air
  
       my limbs may issue from your smoky mouths
  
       so that my soul may but ascend to heaven
  
             the clock strikes the half hour
   
       ah
  half the hour is past
   twill all be past anon 
       o god
  
       if thou wilt not have mercy on my soul
  
       yet for christ s sake
  whose blood hath ransom d me
  
       impose some end to my incessant pain
  
       let faustus live in hell a thousand years
  
       a hundred thousand
  and at last be sav d
  
       o
  no end is limited to damned souls
  
       why wert thou not a creature wanting soul
  
       or why is this immortal that thou hast
  
       ah
  pythagoras  metempsychosis
  were that true
  
       this soul should fly from me
  and i be chang d 
       unto some brutish beast
  174  all beasts are happy
  
       for
  when they die
  
       their souls are soon dissolv d in elements
  
       but mine must live still to be plagu d in hell
  
       curs d be the parents that engender d me
  
       no
  faustus
  curse thyself
  curse lucifer 
       that hath depriv d thee of the joys of heaven
  
             the clock strikes twelve
   
       o
  it strikes
  it strikes
   now
  body
  turn to air
  
       or lucifer will bear thee quick to hell
  
             thunder and lightning
   
       o soul
  be chang d into little water drops
  
       and fall into the ocean

            enter devils
  
   
       my god
  my god
  look not so fierce on me
  
       adders and serpents
  let me breathe a while
  
       ugly hell
  gape not

  lucifer
  
       i ll burn my books
   ah

       chorus
  cut is the branch that might have grown full straight
  
       and burned is apollo s laurel bough
  
       that sometime grew within this learned man
  
       faustus is gone
   regard his hellish fall
  
       whose fiendful fortune may exhort the wise
  
       only to wonder at unlawful things
  
       whose deepness doth entice such forward wits 
       to practice more than heavenly power permits
  
             exit
   
   
       terminat hora diem
  terminat auctor opus
