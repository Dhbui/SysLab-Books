   thou fallest as it were a styked swyn
  
   thy tonge is lost

   of mannes wit and his discrecioun
  
  560 in whom that drynke hath dominacioun 
   he kan no conseil kepe
  it is no drede
  
   now kepe yow fro the white and fro the rede

  580 deyde in his sleep
  with shame and dishonour

   and over al this
  avyseth yow right wel 
   what was comaunded unto lamuel

   namoore of this
  for it may wel suffise
  
   and now that i have spoken of glotonye
  
  590 now wol i yow deffenden hasardrye
  
   hasard is verray mooder of lesynges
  
   and of deceite
  and cursed forswerynges
  
   blaspheme of crist
  manslaughtre
  and wast also 
   of catel and of tyme
  and forthermo
  
   it is repreeve and contrarie of honour 
   for to ben holde a commune hasardour
  
   and ever the hyer he is of estaat
  
   the moore is he yholden desolaat
  
   if that a prynce useth hasardrye
  
  600 in alle governaunce and policye 
   he is
  as by commune opinioun
  
   yholde the lasse in reputacioun
  
   stilboun
  that was a wys embassadour
  
   was sent to corynthe in ful greet honour 
   fro lacidomye to make hire alliaunce
  
   and whan he cam
  hym happede
  par chaunce
  
   that alle the gretteste that were of that lond
  
   pleyynge atte hasard he hem fond
  
   for which
  as soone as it myghte be
  
  610 he stal hym hoom agayn to his contree
  
   and seyde
  
 ther wol i nat lese my name
  
   ne i wol nat take on me so greet defame
  
   yow for to allie unto none hasardours
  
   sendeth othere wise embassadours
  
   for
  by my trouthe
  me were levere dye 
   than i yow sholde to hasardours allye
  
   for ye
  that been so glorious in honours
  
   shul nat allyen yow with hasardours 
   as by my wyl
  ne as by my tretee
 
  
  620 this wise philosophre
  thus seyde hee
  
   looke eek that to the kyng demetrius 
   the kyng of parthes
  as the book seith us
  
   sente him a paire of dees of gold in scorn
  
   for he hadde used hasard ther biforn
  
   for which he heeld his glorie or his renoun 
   at no value or reputacioun
  
   lordes may fynden oother maner pley 
   honest ynough to dryve the day awey
  
   now wol i speke of othes false and grete 
  630 a word or two
  as olde bookes trete
  
   gret sweryng is a thyng abhominable
  
   and fals sweryng is yet moore reprevable
  
   the heighe god forbad sweryng at al
  
   witnesse on mathew
  but in special 
   of sweryng seith the hooly jeremye
  
   
 thou shalt swere sooth thyne othes
  and nat lye
  
   and swere in doom and eek in rightwisnesse
 
  
   but ydel sweryng is a cursednesse
  
   bihoold and se that in the firste table 
  640 of heighe goddes heestes honurable
  
   hou that the seconde heeste of hym is this
  
   
 take nat my name in ydel or amys
 
  
   lo
  rather he forbedeth swich sweryng 
   than homycide or many a cursed thyng
  
   i seye that
  as by ordre
  thus it stondeth
  
   this knoweth
  that his heestes understondeth
  
   how that the seconde heeste of god is that
  
   and forther over
  i wol thee telle al plat 
   that vengeance shal nat parten from his hous 
  650 that of his othes is to outrageous
  
   
 by goddes precious herte
 
  and 
 by his nayles
 
  
   and 
 by the blood of crist that is in hayles
  
   sevene is my chaunce
  and thyn is cynk and treye
 
  
   
 by goddes armes
  if thou falsly pleye
  
   this daggere shal thurghout thyn herte go
 
     
   this fruyt cometh of the bicched bones two
  
   forsweryng
  ire
  falsnesse
  homycide
  
   now
  for the love of crist
  that for us dyde
  
   lete youre othes
  bothe grete and smale
  
  660 but
  sires
  now wol i telle forth my tale
  
   thise riotoures thre of whiche i telle
  
   longe erst er prime rong of any belle

   ther cam a privee theef men clepeth deeth
  
   that in this contree al the peple sleeth
  
   and with his spere he smoot his herte atwo
  
   and wente his wey withouten wordes mo
  
   he hath a thousand slayn this pestilence
  
  680 and
  maister
  er ye come in his presence
  
   me thynketh that it were necessarie 
   for to be war of swich an adversarie
  
   beth redy for to meete hym everemoore
  
   thus taughte me my dame

  690 to been avysed greet wysdom it were
  
   er that he dide a man a dishonour
 
  
   
 ye
  goddes armes
 
  quod this riotour
  
   
 is it swich peril with hym for to meete
  
   i shal hym seke by wey and eek by strete
  
   i make avow to goddes digne bones
  
   herkneth

   togidres han thise thre hir trouthes plight 
   to lyve and dyen ech of hem for oother
  
   as though he were his owene ybore brother
  
   and up they stirte
  al dronken in this rage
  
   and forth they goon towardes that village 
   of which the taverner hadde spoke biforn
  
   and many a grisly ooth thanne han they sworn
  
   and cristes blessed body they torente    
  710 deeth shal be deed
  if that they may hym hente
  
   whan they han goon nat fully half a mile
  
   right as they wolde han troden over a stile
  
   an oold man and a povre with hem mette
  
   this olde man ful mekely hem grette
  
   and seyde thus

   neither in citee ne in no village
  
   that wolde chaunge his youthe for myn age

   but myghte this gold be caried fro this place 
   hoom to myn hous

   for wel ye woot that al this gold is oures    
   thanne were we in heigh felicitee
  
   but trewely
  by daye it may nat bee
  
   men wolde seyn that we were theves stronge
  
  790 and for oure owene tresor doon us honge
  
   this tresor moste ycaried be by nyghte 
   as wisely and as slyly as it myghte
  
   wherfore i rede that cut among us alle

  800 whan it is nyght
  we wol this tresor carie
  
   by oon assent

   that oon of hem the cut broghte in his fest

   that shal departed been among us thre
  
   but nathelees
  if i kan shape it so

   hadde i nat doon a freendes torn to thee
 
  
   that oother answerde

  seyde the firste shrewe
  
  820 
 and i shal tellen in a wordes fewe 
   what we shal doon

  which that wente to the toun
  
   ful ofte in herte he rolleth up and doun 
   the beautee of thise floryns newe and brighte
  
  840 
 o lord
 
  quod he
  
 if so were that i myghte 
   have al this tresor to myself allone
  
   ther is no man that lyveth under the trone 
   of god that sholde lyve so murye as i
 
  
   and atte laste the feend
  oure enemy
  
   putte in his thought that he sholde poyson beye
  
   with which he myghte sleen his felawes tweye
  
   for why the feend foond hym in swich lyvynge 
   that he hadde leve him to sorwe brynge
  
   for this was outrely his fulle entente
  
  850 to sleen hem bothe and nevere to repente
  
   and forth he gooth
  no lenger wolde he tarie
  
   into the toun
  unto a pothecarie
  
   and preyde hym that he hym wolde selle 
   som poyson
  that he myghte his rattes quelle
  
   and eek ther was a polcat in his hawe
  
   that
  as he seyde
  his capouns hadde yslawe
  
   and fayn he wolde wreke hym
  if he myghte
  
   on vermyn that destroyed hym by nyghte
  
   the pothecarie answerde
  
 and thou shalt have 
  860 a thyng that
  also god my soule save
  
   in al this world ther is no creature 
   that eten or dronken hath of this confiture 
   noght but the montance of a corn of whete
  
   that he ne shal his lif anon forlete
  
   ye
  sterve he shal
  and that in lasse while 
   than thou wolt goon a paas nat but a mile
  
   this poysoun is so strong and violent
 
  
   this cursed man hath in his hond yhent 
   this poysoun in a box
  and sith he ran 
  870 into the nexte strete unto a man
  
   and borwed  of  hym large botelles thre
  
   and in the two his poyson poured he
  
   the thridde he kepte clene for his drynke
  
   for al the nyght he shoop hym for to swynke 
   in cariynge of the gold out of that place
  
   and whan this riotour
  with sory grace
  
   hadde filled with wyn his grete botels thre
  
   to his felawes agayn repaireth he
