   my lord hem tempreth

   now he is goon

  he kan doon craftily
  
   algate i woot wel he hath swich a name

   and wite ye how
  ful ofte it happeth so 
   the pot tobreketh

  al is go
  
   thise metals been of so greet violence 
   oure walles mowe nat make hem resistence
  
  910 but if they weren wroght of lym and stoon
  
   they percen so
  and thurgh the wal they goon
  
   and somme of hem synken into the ground    
   thus han we lost by tymes many a pound    
   and somme are scatered al the floor aboute
  
   somme lepe into the roof
  withouten doute
  
   though that the feend noght in oure sighte hym shewe
  
   i trowe he with us be

   nis ther moore wo

  960 and whan we been togidres everichoon
  
   every man semeth a salomon

   nis nat gold
  as that i have herd told
  
   ne every appul that is fair at eye 
   ne is nat good
  what so men clappe or crye
  
   right so
  lo
  fareth it amonges us
  
   he that semeth the wiseste
  by jhesus
  
   is moost fool
  whan it cometh to the preef
  
   and he that semeth trewest is a theef
  
  970 that shul ye knowe
  er that i fro yow wende
  
   by that i of my tale have maad an ende
  
   ther is a chanoun of religioun 
   amonges us
  wolde infecte al a toun
  
   thogh it as greet were as was nynyvee
  
   rome

  and othere three
  
   his sleightes and his infinite falsnesse 
   ther koude no man writen
  as i gesse
  
   though that he myghte lyve a thousand yeer
  
   in al this world of falshede nis his peer
  
  980 for in his termes he wol hym so wynde
  
   and speke his wordes in so sly a kynde
  
   whanne he commune shal with any wight
  
   that he wol make hym doten anonright
  
   but it a feend be
  as hymselven is
  
   ful many a man hath he bigiled er this
  
   and wole
  if that he lyve may a while
  
   and yet men ride and goon ful many a mile 
   hym for to seke and have his aqueyntaunce
  
   noght knowynge of his false governaunce
  
  990 and if yow list to yeve me audience
  
   i wol it tellen heere in youre presence
  
   but worshipful chanons religious
  
   ne demeth nat that i sclaundre youre hous
  
   although that my tale of a chanoun bee
  
   of every ordre som shrewe is

   and god forbede that al a compaignye 
   sholde rewe o singuleer mannes folye
  
   to sclaundre yow is no thyng myn entente
  
   but to correcten that is mys i mente
  
  1000 this tale was nat oonly toold for yow
  
   but eek for othere mo
  ye woot wel how 
   that among cristes apostelles twelve 
   ther nas no traytour but judas hymselve
  
   thanne why sholde al the remenant have a blame 
   that giltlees were
  by yow i seye the same
  
   save oonly this
  if ye wol herkne me
  
   if any judas in youre covent be
  
   remoeveth hym bitymes
  i yow rede
  
   if shame or los may causen any drede
  
  1010 and beeth no thyng displesed
  i yow preye
  
   but in this cas herkneth what i shal seye
  
   in londoun was a preest
  an annueleer
  
   that therinne dwelled hadde many a yeer
  
   which was so plesaunt and so servysable 
   unto the wyf
  where as he was at table
  
   that she wolde suffre hym no thyng for to paye 
   for bord ne clothyng
  wente he never so gaye
  
   and spendyng silver hadde he right ynow
  
   therof no fors
  i wol procede as now
  
  1020 and telle forth my tale of the chanoun 
   that broghte this preest to confusioun
  
   this false chanon cam upon a day 
   unto this preestes chambre
  wher he lay
  
   bisechynge hym to lene hym a certeyn 
   of gold
  and he wolde quite it hym ageyn
  
   
 leene me a marc
 
  quod he
  
 but dayes three
  
   and at my day i wol it quiten thee
  
   and if so be that thow me fynde fals
  
   another day do hange me by the hals
 
  
  1030 this preest hym took a marc
  and that as swithe
  
   and this chanoun hym thanked ofte sithe
  
   and took his leve
  and wente forth his weye
  
   and at the thridde day broghte his moneye
  
   and to the preest he took his gold agayn
  
   wherof this preest was wonder glad and fayn
  
   
 certes
 
  quod he
  
 no thyng anoyeth me 
   to lene a man a noble
  or two
  or thre
  
   or what thyng were in my possessioun
  
   whan he so trewe is of condicioun 
  1040 that in no wise he breke wole his day

   that ther was nevere man yet yvele apayd 
  1050 for gold ne silver that he to me lente

   he bad his servant fecchen hym this thyng

  shortly for to sayn
  
   and took thise ounces thre to the chanoun

   the coles right anon weren yfet

   and his maister shette the dore anon
  
   and to hire labour spedily they gon
  
   this preest
  at this cursed chanons biddyng
  
   upon the fir anon sette this thyng
  
   and blew the fir
  and bisyed hym ful faste
  
   and this chanoun into the crosselet caste 
   a poudre
  noot i wherof that it was 
   ymaad
  outher of chalk

  1150 or somwhat elles
  was nat worth a flye
  
   to blynde with this preest
  and bad hym hye 
   the coles for to couchen al above

   and couched coles as the chanoun bad
  
   and while he bisy was
  this feendly wrecche
  
   this false chanoun    the foule feend hym fecche
     
  1160 out of his bosom took a bechen cole
  
   in which ful subtilly was maad an hole
  
   and therinne put was of silver lemaille 
   an ounce
  and stopped was
  withouten faille
  
   this hole with wex
  to kepe the lemaille in
  
   and understondeth that this false gyn 
   was nat maad ther
  but it was maad bifore
  
   and othere thynges i shal tellen moore 
   herafterward
  whiche that he with hym broghte
  
   er he cam there
  hym to bigile he thoghte
  
  1170 and so he dide
  er that they wente atwynne
  
   til he had terved hym
  koude he nat blynne
  
   it dulleth me whan that i of hym speke
  
   on his falshede fayn wolde i me wreke
  
   if i wiste how
  but he is heere and there
  
   he is so variaunt
  he abit nowhere
  
   but taketh heede now
  sires
  for goddes love
  
   he took his cole of which i spak above
  
   and in his hand he baar it pryvely
  
   and whiles the preest couched bisily 
  1180 the coles
  as i tolde yow er this

   and whiles that the preest wiped his face
  
   this chanoun took his cole    with sory grace
     
  1190 and leyde it above upon the myddeward 
   of the crosselet
  and blew wel afterward 
   til that the coles gonne faste brenne
  
   
 now yeve us drynke
 
  quod the chanoun thenne
  
   
 as swithe al shal be wel
  i undertake
  
   sitte we doun

   and whan that this chanounes bechen cole

   into the crosselet fil anon adoun
  
   and so it moste nedes
  by resoun
  
  1200 syn it so evene above couched was
  
   but therof wiste the preest nothyng
  alas
  
   he demed alle the coles yliche good
  
   for of that sleighte he nothyng understood
  
   and whan this alkamystre saugh his tyme
  
   
 ris up
 
  quod he
  
 sire preest

   for i wol make it of the same shap 
   that is an ingot

  1210 and bryngeth eek with yow a bolle or a panne 
   ful of water

   they opened and shette
  and wente hir weye
  
   and forth with hem they carieden the keye
  
  1220 and coome agayn withouten any delay
  
   what sholde i tarien al the longe day
  
   he took the chalk and shoop it in the wise 
   of an ingot
  as i shal yow devyse
  
   i seye
  he took out of his owene sleeve 
   a teyne of silver    yvele moot he cheeve
     
   which that ne was nat but an ounce of weighte
  
   and taaketh heede now of his cursed sleighte
  
   he shoop his ingot in lengthe and in breede 
   of this teyne
  withouten any drede
  
  1230 so slyly that the preest it nat espide
  
   and in his sleve agayn he gan it hide
  
   and fro the fir he took up his mateere
  
   and in th  yngot putte it with myrie cheere
  
   and in the water vessel he it caste
  
   whan that hym luste
  and bad the preest as faste
  
   
 loke what ther is

   thow fynde shalt ther silver
  as i hope
 
  
   what
  devel of helle
  sholde it elles be
  
   shaving of silver silver is
  pardee
  
  1240 he putte his hand in and took up a teyne 
   of silver fyn
  and glad in every veyne 
   was this preest
  whan he saugh it was so
  
   
 goddes blessyng
  and his moodres also
  
   and alle halwes
  have ye
  sire chanoun
 
  
   seyde the preest
  
 and i hir malisoun
  
   but
  and ye vouche sauf to techen me 
   this noble craft and this subtilitee
  
   i wol be youre in al that evere i may
 
  
   quod the chanoun
  
 yet wol i make assay 
  1250 the seconde tyme
  that ye may taken heede 
   and been expert of this
  and in youre neede 
   another day assaye in myn absence 
   this disciplyne and this crafty science
  
   lat take another ounce
 
  quod he tho
  
   
 of quyksilver
  withouten wordes mo
  
   and do therwith as ye han doon er this 
   with that oother
  which that now silver is
 
  
   this preest hym bisieth in al that he kan 
   to doon as this chanoun
  this cursed man
  
  1260 comanded hym
  and faste blew the fir
  
   for to come to th  effect of his desir
  
   and this chanon
  right in the meene while
  
   al redy was this preest eft to bigile
  
   and for a contenaunce in his hand he bar 
   an holwe stikke    taak kep and be war
     
   in the ende of which an ounce
  and namoore
  
   of silver lemaille put was
  as bifore 
   was in his cole
  and stopped with wex weel 
   for to kepe in his lemaille every deel
  
  1270 and whil this preest was in his bisynesse
  
   this chanoun with his stikke gan hym dresse 
   to hym anon
  and his poudre caste in 
   as he dide er    the devel out of his skyn 
   hym terve
  i pray to god
  for his falshede
  
   for he was evere fals in thoght and dede    
   and with this stikke
  above the crosselet
  
   that was ordeyned with that false jet
  
   he stired the coles til relente gan 
   the wex agayn the fir
  as every man
  
  1280 but it a fool be
  woot wel it moot nede
  
   and al that in the stikke was out yede
  
   and in the crosselet hastily it fel
  
   now
  good sires
  what wol ye bet than wel
  
   whan that this preest thus was bigiled ageyn
  
   supposynge noght but treuthe
  sooth to seyn
  
   he was so glad that i kan nat expresse 
   in no manere his myrthe and his gladnesse
  
   and to the chanoun he profred eftsoone 
   body and good
  
 ye
 
  quod the chanoun soone
  
  1290 
 though poure i be
  crafty thou shalt me fynde
  
   i warne thee
  yet is ther moore bihynde
  
   is ther any coper herinne
 
  seyde he
  
   
 ye
 
  quod the preest
  
 sire
  i trowe wel ther be
 
  
   
 elles go bye us som
  and that as swithe
  
   now
  goode sire
  go forth thy wey and hy the
 
  
   he wente his wey
  and with the coper cam
  
   and this chanon it in his handes nam
  
   and of that coper weyed out but an ounce
  
   al to symple is my tonge to pronounce
  
  1300 as ministre of my wit
  the doublenesse 
   of this chanoun
  roote of alle cursednesse
  
   he semed freendly to hem that knewe hym noght
  
   but he was feendly bothe in werk and thoght
  
   it weerieth me to telle of his falsnesse
  
   and nathelees yet wol i it expresse
  
   to th  entente that men may be war therby
  
   and for noon oother cause
  trewely
  
   he putte this ounce of coper in the crosselet
  
   and on the fir as swithe he hath it set
  
  1310 and caste in poudre
  and made the preest to blowe
  
   and in his werkyng for to stoupe lowe
  
   as he dide er    and al nas but a jape
  
   right as hym liste
  the preest he made his ape
  
   and afterward in the ingot he it caste
  
   and in the panne putte it at the laste 
   of water
  and in he putte his owene hand
  
   and in his sleve  as ye biforen hand 
   herde me telle  he hadde a silver teyne
  
   he slyly took it out
  this cursed heyne
  
  1320 unwityng this preest of his false craft
  
   and in the pannes botme he hath it laft
  
   and in the water rombled to and fro
  
   and wonder pryvely took up also 
   the coper teyne
  noght knowynge this preest
  
   and hidde it
  and hym hente by the breest
  
   and to hym spak
  and thus seyde in his game
  
   
 stoupeth adoun
  by god
  ye be to blame
  
   helpeth me now
  as i dide yow whileer
  
   putte in youre hand
  and looketh what is theer
 
  
  1330 this preest took up this silver teyne anon
  
   and thanne seyde the chanoun
  
 lat us gon 
   with thise thre teynes
  whiche that we han wroght
  
   to som goldsmyth and wite if they been oght
  
   for
  by my feith
  i nolde
  for myn hood
  
   but if that they were silver fyn and good
  
   and that as swithe preeved it shal bee
 
  
   unto the goldsmyth with thise teynes three 
   they wente and putte thise teynes in assay 
   to fir and hamer
  myghte no man seye nay
  
  1340 but that they weren as hem oghte be
  
   this sotted preest
  who was gladder than he
  
   was nevere brid gladder agayn the day
  
   ne nyghtyngale
  in the sesoun of may
  
   was nevere noon that luste bet to synge
  
   ne lady lustier in carolynge
  
   or for to speke of love and wommanhede
  
   ne knyght in armes to doon an hardy dede
  
   to stonden in grace of his lady deere
  
   than hadde this preest this soory craft to leere
  
  1350 and to the chanoun thus he spak and seyde
  
   
 for love of god
  that for us alle deyde
  
   and as i may deserve it unto yow
  
   what shal this receite coste
  telleth now
 
  
   
 by oure lady
 
  quod this chanon
  
 it is deere
  
   i warne yow wel
  for save i and a frere
  
   in engelond ther kan no man it make
 
  
   
 no fors
 
  quod he
  
 now

  for goddes sake
  
   what shal i paye
  telleth me
  i preye
 
  
   
 ywis
 
  quod he
  
 it is ful deere
  i seye
  
  1360 sire
  at o word
  if that thee list it have
  
   ye shul paye fourty pound
  so god me save
  
   and nere the freendshipe that ye dide er this 
   to me
  ye sholde paye moore
  ywis
 
  
   this preest the somme of fourty pound anon 
   of nobles fette
  and took hem everichon 
   to this chanoun for this ilke receite
  
   al his werkyng nas but fraude and deceite
  
   
 sire preest
 
  he seyde
  
 i kepe han no loos 
   of my craft
  for i wolde it kept were cloos
  
  1370 and
  as ye love me
  kepeth it secree
  
   for
  and men knewen al my soutiltee
  
   by god
  they wolden han so greet envye 
   to me by cause of my philosophye 
   i sholde be deed
  ther were noon oother weye
 
  
   
 god it forbeede
 
  quod the preest
  
 what sey ye
  
   yet hadde i levere spenden al the good 
   which that i have
  and elles wexe i wood
  
   than that ye sholden falle in swich mescheef
 
  
   
 for youre good wyl
  sire
  have ye right good preef
 
  
  1380 quod the chanoun
  
 and farwel
  grant mercy
 
  
   he wente his wey
  and never the preest hym sy 
   after that day
  and whan that this preest shoolde 
   maken assay
  at swich tyme as he wolde
  
   of this receit
  farwel
  it wolde nat be
  
   lo
  thus byjaped and bigiled was he
  
   thus maketh he his introduccioun
  
   to brynge folk to hir destruccioun
  
   considereth
  sires
  how that
  in ech estaat
  
   bitwixe men and gold ther is debaat 
  1390 so ferforth that unnethes is ther noon
  
   this multiplying blent so many oon 
   that in good feith i trowe that it bee 
   the cause grettest of swich scarsetee
  
   philosophres speken so mystily 
   in this craft that men kan nat come therby
  
   for any wit that men han now a dayes
  
   they mowe wel chiteren as doon jayes
  
   and in hir termes sette hir lust and peyne
  
   but to hir purpos shul they nevere atteyne
  
  1400 a man may lightly lerne
  if he have aught
  
   to multiplie
  and brynge his good to naught
  
   lo
  swich a lucre is in this lusty game
  
   a mannes myrthe it wol turne unto grame
  
   and empten also grete and hevye purses
  
   and maken folk for to purchacen curses 
   of hem that han hir good therto ylent
  
   o
  fy
  for shame
  they that han been brent
  
   allas
  kan they nat flee the fires heete
  
   ye that it use
  i rede ye it leete
  
  1410 lest ye lese al
  for bet than nevere is late
  
   nevere to thryve were to long a date
  
   though ye prolle ay
  ye shul it nevere fynde
  
   ye been as boold as is bayard the blynde
  
   that blondreth forth and peril casteth noon
  
   he is as boold to renne agayn a stoon 
   as for to goon bisides in the weye
  
   so faren ye that multiplie
  i seye
  
   if that youre eyen kan nat seen aright
  
   looke that youre mynde lakke noght his sight
  
  1420 for though ye looken never so brode and stare
  
   ye shul nothyng wynne on that chaffare
  
   but wasten al that ye may rape and renne
  
   withdraweth the fir
  lest it to faste brenne
  
   medleth namoore with that art
  i mene
  
   for if ye doon
  youre thrift is goon ful clene
  
   and right as swithe i wol yow tellen heere 
   what philosophres seyn in this mateere
  
   lo
  thus seith arnold of the newe toun
  
   as his rosarie maketh mencioun
  
  1430 he seith right thus
  withouten any lye
  
   
 ther may no man mercurie mortifie 
   but it be with his brother knowlechyng
 
  
   how  be  that he which that first seyde this thyng 
   of philosophres fader was
  hermes
  
   he seith how that the dragon
  doutelees
  
   ne dyeth nat but if that he be slayn 
   with his brother
  and that is for to sayn
  
   by the dragon
  mercurie
  and noon oother 
   he understood
  and brymstoon by his brother
  
  1440 that out of sol and luna were ydrawe
  
   
 and therfore
 
  seyde he    taak heede to my sawe    
   
 lat no man bisye hym this art for to seche
  
   but if that he th  entencioun and speche 
   of philosophres understonde kan
  
   and if he do
  he is a lewed man
  
   for this science and this konnyng
 
  quod he
  
   
 is of the secree of the secretes
  pardee
 
  
   also ther was a disciple of plato
  
   that on a tyme seyde his maister to
  
  1450 as his book senior wol bere witnesse
  
   and this was his demande in soothfastnesse
  
   
 telle me the name of the privee stoon
 
  
   and plato answerde unto hym anoon
  
   
 take the stoon that titanos men name
 
  
   
 which is that
 
  quod he
  
 magnasia is the same
 
  
   seyde plato
  
 ye
  sire
  and is it thus
  
   this is ignotum per ignocius
  
   what is magnasia
  good sire
  i yow preye
 
  
   
 it is a water that is maad
  i seye
  
  1460 of elementes foure
 
  quod plato
  
   
 telle me the roote
  good sire
 
  quod he tho
  
   
 of that water
  if it be youre wil
 
  
   
 nay
  nay
 
  quod plato
  
 certein
  that i nyl
  
   the philosophres sworn were everychoon 
   that they sholden discovere it unto noon
  
   ne in no book it write in no manere
  
   for unto crist it is so lief and deere 
   that he wol nat that it discovered bee
  
   but where it liketh to his deitee 
  1470 men for t  enspire
  and eek for to deffende 
   whom that hym liketh
  lo
  this is the ende
 
  
   thanne conclude i thus
  sith that god of hevene 
   ne wil nat that the philosophres nevene 
   how that a man shal come unto this stoon
  
   i rede
  as for the beste
  lete it goon
  
   for whoso maketh god his adversarie
  
   as for to werken any thyng in contrarie 
   of his wil
  certes
  never shal he thryve
  
   thogh that he multiplie terme of his lyve
  
  1480 and there a poynt
  for ended is my tale
  
   god sende every trewe man boote of his bale
