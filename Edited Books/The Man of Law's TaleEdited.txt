   som men wolde seyn at requeste of custance 
  1010 this senatour hath lad this child to feeste
  
   i may nat tellen every circumstance    
   be as be may
  ther was he at the leeste
  
   but sooth is this
  that at his moodres heeste 
   biforn alla
  durynge the metes space
  
   the child stood
  lookynge in the kynges face
  
   this alla kyng hath of this child greet wonder
  
   and to the senatour he seyde anon
  
   
 whos is that faire child that stondeth yonder
 
  
   
 i noot

  1030 now was this child as lyk unto custance 
   as possible is a creature to be
  
   this alla hath the face in remembrance 
   of dame custance
  and ther on mused he 
   if that the childes mooder were aught she
