 a marchant whilom dwelled at seint denys
  
   that riche was
  for which men helde hym wys
  
   a wyf he hadde of excellent beautee
  
   and compaignable and revelous was she
  
   which is a thyng that causeth more dispence 
   than worth is al the chiere and reverence 
   that men hem doon at festes and at daunces
  
   swiche salutaciouns and contenaunces 
   passen as dooth a shadwe upon the wal
  
  10 but wo is hym that payen moot for al
  
   the sely housbonde
  algate he moot paye
  
   he moot us clothe
  and he moot us arraye
  
   al for his owene worshipe richely
  
   in which array we daunce jolily
  
   and if that he noght may
  par aventure
  
   or ellis list no swich dispence endure
  
   but thynketh it is wasted and ylost
  
   thanne moot another payen for oure cost
  
   or lene us gold
  and that is perilous
  
  20 this noble marchaunt heeld a worthy hous
  
   for which he hadde alday so greet repair 
   for his largesse
  and for his wyf was fair
  
   that wonder is
  but herkneth to my tale

   ther was a monk
  a fair man and a boold    
   i trowe a thritty wynter he was oold    
   that evere in oon was drawynge to that place
  
   this yonge monk
  that was so fair of face
  
   aqueynted was so with the goode man
  
  30 sith that hir firste knoweliche bigan
  
   that in his hous as famulier was he 
   as it is possible any freend to be

   were bothe two yborn in o village
  
   the monk hym claymeth as for cosynage
  
   and he agayn
  he seith nat ones nay
  
   but was as glad therof as fowel of day
  
   for to his herte it was a greet plesaunce
  
  40 thus been they knyt with eterne alliaunce
  
   and ech of hem gan oother for t  assure 
   of bretherhede whil that hir lyf may dure
  
   free was daun john
  and manly of dispence
  
   as in that hous
  and ful of diligence 
   to doon plesaunce
  and also greet costage
  
   he noght forgat to yeve the leeste page 
   in al that hous
  but after hir degree
  
   he yaf the lord
  and sitthe al his meynee
  
   whan that he cam
  som manere honest thyng
  
  50 for which they were as glad of his comyng 
   as fowel is fayn whan that the sonne up riseth
  
   na moore of this as now
  for it suffiseth
  
   but so bifel

   shoop hym to make redy his array 
   toward the toun of brugges for to fare
  
   to byen there a porcioun of ware
