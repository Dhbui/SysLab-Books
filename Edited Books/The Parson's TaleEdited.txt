 oure sweete lord god of hevene
  that no man wole perisse but wole that 
   we comen alle to the knoweleche of hym and to the blisful lif that is perdurable
  
   amonesteth us by the prophete jeremie
  that seith in thys wyse
  
   
 stondeth upon the weyes
  and seeth and axeth of olde pathes  that is to seyn
  of olde sentences  which is the goode wey
  
   and walketh in that wey
  and ye shal fynde refresshynge for youre soules
  etc
 
  
   manye been the weyes espirituels that leden folk to oure lord jhesu crist and to the regne of glorie
  
  80 of whiche weyes ther is a ful noble wey and a ful covenable
  which may nat fayle to man ne to womman 
  80a that thurgh synne hath mysgoon fro the righte wey of jerusalem celestial
  
   and this wey is cleped penitence
  of which man sholde gladly herknen and enquere with al his herte 
   to wyten what is penitence
  and whennes it is cleped penitence
  and in how manye maneres been the acciouns or werkynges of penitence
  
   and how manye speces ther been of penitence
  and whiche thynges apertenen and bihoven to penitence
  and whiche thynges destourben penitence
  
   seint ambrose seith that penitence is the pleynynge of man for the gilt that he hath doon
  
   and namoore to do any thyng for which hym oghte to pleyne
  
   and som doctour seith
  
 penitence is the waymentynge of man that sorweth for his synne and pyneth hymself for he hath mysdoon
 
  
   penitence
  with certeyne circumstances
  is verray repentance of a man that halt hymself in sorwe and oother peyne for his giltes
  
   and for he shal be verray penitent
  he shal first biwaylen the synnes that he hath doon
  
   and stidefastly purposen in his herte to have shrift of mouthe
  and to doon satisfaccioun
  
   and nevere to doon thyng for which hym oghte moore to biwayle 
   or to compleyne
  and to continue in goode werkes
  or elles his repentance may nat availle
  
   for
  as seith seint ysidre
  
   
 he is a japere and a gabbere and no verray repentant that eftsoone dooth thyng for which hym oghte repente
 
  
  90 wepynge
  and nat for to stynte to do synne
  may nat avayle
  
   but nathelees
  men shal hope that every tyme that man falleth
  be it never so ofte
  
   that he may arise thurgh penitence
  if he have grace
  but certeinly it is greet doute
  
   for
  as seith seint gregorie
  
 unnethe ariseth he out of his synne
  that is charged with the charge of yvel usage
 
  
   and therfore repentant folk
  that stynte for to synne and forlete synne er that synne forlete hem
  
   hooly chirche holdeth hem siker of hire savacioun
  
   and he that synneth and verraily repenteth hym in his laste
  hooly chirche yet hopeth his savacioun
  
   by the grete mercy of oure lord jhesu crist
  for his repentaunce
  but taak the siker wey
  
   and now
  sith i have declared yow what thyng is penitence
  now shul ye understonde that ther been three acciouns of penitence
  
   the firste is that if a man be baptized after that he hath synned
  
   seint augustyn seith
  
 but he be penytent for his olde synful lyf
  he may nat bigynne the newe clene lif
 
  
   for
  certes
  if he be baptized withouten penitence of his olde gilt
  he receyveth the mark of baptesme 
   but nat the grace ne the remission of his synnes
  til he have repentance verray
  
   another defaute is this
  that men doon deedly synne after that they han receyved baptesme
  
  100 the thridde defaute is that men fallen in venial synnes after hir baptesme fro day to day
  
   therof seith seint augustyn that penitence of goode and humble folk is the penitence of every day
  
   the speces of penitence been three
  that oon of hem is solempne
  another is commune
  and the thridde is privee
  
   thilke penance that is solempne is in two maneres
  
   as to be put out of hooly chirche in lente for slaughtre of children
  and swich maner thyng
  
   another is
  whan a man hath synned openly
  of which synne the fame is openly spoken in the contree
  
   and thanne hooly chirche by juggement destreyneth hym for to do open penaunce
  
   commune penaunce is that preestes enjoynen men communly in certeyn caas
  as for to goon peraventure naked in pilgrimages
  or barefoot
  
   pryvee penaunce is thilke that men doon alday for privee synnes
  of whiche we shryve us prively and receyve privee penaunce
  
   now shaltow understande what is bihovely and necessarie to verray parfit penitence
  and this stant on three thynges
  
   contricioun of herte
  confessioun of mouth
  and satisfaccioun
  
   for which seith seint john crisostom
  
 penitence destreyneth a man to accepte benygnely every peyne that hym is enjoyned
  
   with contricioun of herte
  and shrift of mouth
  with satisfaccioun
  and in werkynge of alle manere humylitee
 
  
  110 and this is fruytful penitence agayn three thynges in which we wratthe oure lord jhesu crist
  
   this is to seyn
  by delit in thynkynge
  by reccheleesnesse in spekynge
  and by wikked synful werkynge
  
   and agayns thise wikkede giltes is penitence
  that may be likned unto a tree
  
   the roote of this tree is contricioun
  that hideth hym in the herte of hym that is verray repentaunt
  
   right as the roote of a tree hydeth hym in the erthe
  
   of the roote of contricioun spryngeth a stalke that bereth braunches and leves of confessioun
  and fruyt of satisfaccioun
  
   for which crist seith in his gospel
  
 dooth digne fruyt of penitence
 
  for by this fruyt may men knowe this tree
  
   and nat by the roote that is hyd in the herte of man
  ne by the braunches
  ne by the leves of confessioun
  
   and therfore oure lord jhesu crist seith thus
  
 by the fruyt of hem shul ye knowen hem
 
  
   of this roote eek spryngeth a seed of grace
  the which seed is mooder of sikernesse
  and this seed is egre and hoot
  
   the grace of this seed spryngeth of god thurgh remembrance of the day of doom and on the peynes of helle
  
   of this matere seith salomon that in the drede of god man forleteth his synne
  
  120 the heete of this seed is the love of god and the desiryng of the joye perdurable
  
   this heete draweth the herte of a man to god and dooth hym haten his synne
  
   for soothly ther is nothyng that savoureth so wel to a child as the milk of his norice
  
   ne nothyng is to hym moore abhomynable than thilke milk whan it is medled with oother mete
  
   right so the synful man that loveth his synne
  hym semeth that it is to him moost sweete of any thyng
  
   but fro that tyme that he loveth sadly oure lord jhesu crist
  
   and desireth the lif perdurable
  ther nys to him no thyng moore abhomynable
  
   for soothly the lawe of god is the love of god
  for which david the prophete seith
  
   
 i have loved thy lawe and hated wikkednesse and hate
 
  he that loveth god kepeth his lawe and his word
  
   this tree saugh the prophete daniel in spirit
  upon the avysioun of the kyng nabugodonosor
  whan he conseiled hym to do penitence
  
   penaunce is the tree of lyf to hem that it receyven
  
   and he that holdeth hym in verray penitence is blessed
  after the sentence of salomon
  
   in this penitence or contricioun man shal understonde foure thynges
  that is to seyn
  what is contricioun
  
   and whiche been the causes that moeven a man to contricioun
  and how he sholde be contrit
  and what contricioun availleth to the soule
  
   thanne is it thus
  that contricioun is the verray sorwe that a man receyveth in his herte for his synnes
  
   with sad purpos to shryve hym
  and to do penaunce
  and neveremoore to do synne
  
  130 and this sorwe shal been in this manere
  as seith seint bernard
  
  130a 
 it shal been hevy and grevous
  and ful sharp and poynaunt in herte
 
  
   first
  for man hath agilt his lord and his creatour
  and moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath agilt hys fader celestial
  
   and yet moore sharp and poynaunt for he hath wrathed and agilt hym that boghte hym
  that with his precious blood hath delivered us 
   fro the bondes of synne
  and fro the crueltee of the devel
  and fro the peynes of helle
  
   the causes that oghte moeve a man to contricioun been sixe
  first a man shal remembre hym of his synnes
  
   but looke he that thilke remembraunce ne be to hym no delit by no wey
  but greet shame and sorwe for his gilt
  
   for job seith
  
 synful men doon werkes worthy of confusioun
 
  
   and therfore seith ezechie
  
 i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lyf in bitternesse of myn herte
 
  
   and god seith in the apocalipse
  
 remembreth yow fro whennes that ye been falle
 
  
   for biforn that tyme that ye synned
  ye were the children of god and lymes of the regne of god
  
   but for youre synne ye been woxen thral
  and foul
  and membres of the feend
  hate of aungels
  sclaundre of hooly chirche
  
   and foode of the false serpent
  perpetueel matere of the fir of helle
  
   and yet moore foul and abhomynable
  for ye trespassen so ofte tyme as dooth the hound that retourneth to eten his spewyng
  
   and yet be ye fouler for youre longe continuyng in synne and youre synful usage
  
   for which ye be roten in youre synne
  as a beest in his dong
  
  140 swiche manere of thoghtes maken a man to have shame of his synne
  and no delit
  as god seith by the prophete ezechiel
  
   
 ye shal remembre yow of youre weyes
  and they shuln displese yow
 
  soothly synnes been the weyes that leden folk to helle
  
   the seconde cause that oghte make a man to have desdeyn of synne is this
  
   that
  as seith seint peter
  
 whoso that dooth synne is thral of synne
 
  and synne put a man in greet thraldom
  
   and therfore seith the prophete ezechiel
  
 i wente sorweful in desdayn of myself
 
  
   certes
  wel oghte a man have desdayn of synne and withdrawe hym from that thraldom and vileynye
  
   and lo
  what seith seneca in this matere
  he seith thus
  
 though i wiste that neither god ne man ne sholde nevere knowe it
  
   yet wolde i have desdayn for to do synne
 
  
   and the same seneca also seith
  
 i am born to gretter thynges than to be thral to my body
  
   or than for to maken of my body a thral
 
  
   ne a fouler thral may no man ne womman maken of his body than for to yeven his body to synne
  
   al were it the fouleste cherl or the fouleste womman that lyveth
  and leest of value
  
   yet is he thanne moore foul and moore in servitute
  
   evere fro the hyer degree that man falleth
  the moore is he thral
  and moore to god and to the world vile and abhomynable
  
   o goode god
  wel oghte man have desdayn of synne
  sith that thurgh synne ther he was free now is he maked bonde
  
  150 and therfore seyth seint augustyn
  
 if thou hast desdayn of thy servant
  
  150a if he agilte or synne
  have thou thanne desdayn that thou thyself sholdest do synne
 
  
   tak reward of thy value
  that thou ne be to foul to thyself
  
   allas
  wel oghten they thanne have desdayn to been servauntz and thralles to synne
  and soore been ashamed of hemself 
   that god of his endelees goodnesse hath set hem in heigh estaat
  or yeven hem wit
  strengthe of body
  heele
  beautee
  prosperitee
  
   and boghte hem fro the deeth with his herte blood
  
   that they so unkyndely
  agayns his gentilesse
  quiten hym so vileynsly to slaughtre of hir owene soules
  
   o goode god
  ye wommen that been of so greet beautee
  remembreth yow of the proverbe of salomon
  he seith
  
   
 likneth a fair womman that is a fool of hire body 
   lyk to a ryng of gold that were in the groyn of a soughe
 
  
   for right as a soughe wroteth in everich ordure
  so wroteth she hire beautee in the stynkynge ordure of synne
  
   the thridde cause that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is drede of the day of doom and of the horrible peynes of helle
  
   for as seint jerome seith
  
 at every tyme that me remembreth of the day of doom i quake
  
  160 for whan i ete or drynke
  or what so that i do
  evere semeth me that the trompe sowneth in myn ere
  
    riseth up
  ye that been dede
  and cometh to the juggement
  
  
   o goode god
  muchel oghte a man to drede swich a juggement
  
 ther as we shullen been alle
 
  
   as seint poul seith
  
 biforn the seete of oure lord jhesu crist
 
  
   whereas he shal make a general congregacioun
  whereas no man may been absent
  
   for certes there availleth noon essoyne ne excusacioun
  
   and nat oonly that oure defautes shullen be jugged
  but eek that alle oure werkes shullen openly be knowe
  
   and
  as seith seint bernard
  
 ther ne shal no pledynge availle
  ne no sleighte
  we shullen yeven rekenynge of everich ydel word
 
  
   ther shul we han a juge that may nat been deceyved ne corrupt
  and why
  
   for
  certes
  alle oure thoghtes been discovered as to hym
  ne for preyere ne for meede he shal nat been corrupt
  
   and therfore seith salomon
  
 the wratthe of god ne wol nat spare no wight
  for preyere ne for yifte
 
  
   and therfore
  at the day of doom ther nys noon hope to escape
  
   wherfore
  as seith seint anselm
  
 ful greet angwyssh shul the synful folk have at that tyme
  
  170 ther shal the stierne and wrothe juge sitte above
  and under hym the horrible pit of helle open to destroyen hym 
  170a that moot biknowen his synnes
  whiche synnes openly been shewed biforn god and biforn every creature
  
   and in the left syde mo develes than herte may bithynke
  for to harye and drawe the synful soules to the peyne of helle
  
   and withinne the hertes of folk shal be the bitynge conscience
  and withouteforth shal be the world al brennynge
  
   whider shal thanne the wrecched synful man flee to hiden hym
  certes
  he may nat hyden hym
  he moste come forth and shewen hym
 
  
   for certes
  as seith seint jerome
  
 the erthe shal casten hym out of hym
  and the see also
  
   and the eyr also
  that shal be ful of thonder clappes and lightnynges
 
  
   now soothly
  whoso wel remembreth hym of thise thynges
  i gesse that his synne shal nat turne hym into delit
  
   but to greet sorwe for drede of the peyne of helle
  
   and therfore seith job to god
  
 suffre
  lord
  that i may a while biwaille and wepe
  
   er i go withoute returnyng to the derke lond
  covered with the derknesse of deeth
  
   to the lond of mysese and of derknesse
  whereas is the shadwe of deeth
  
   whereas ther is noon ordre or ordinaunce but grisly drede that evere shal laste
 
  
   loo
  heere may ye seen that job preyde respit a while to biwepe and waille his trespas
  
   for soothly oo day of respit is bettre than al the tresor of this world
  
   and forasmuche as a man may acquiten hymself biforn god by penitence in this world
  and nat by tresor
  
   therfore sholde he preye to god to yeve hym respit a while to biwepe and biwaillen his trespas
  
  180 for certes
  al the sorwe that a man myghte make fro the bigynnyng of the world 
  180a nys but a litel thyng at regard of the sorwe of helle
  
   the cause why that job clepeth helle the 
 lond of derkness
 
 
  
   understondeth that he clepeth it 
 lond
  or erthe
  for it is stable and nevere shal faille
  
 derk
 
  
   for he that is in helle hath defaute of light material
  
   for certes
  the derke light that shal come out of the fyr that evere shal brenne 
   shal turne hym al to peyne that is in helle for it sheweth him to the horrible develes that hym tormenten
  
   
 covered with the derknesse of deeth
     that is to seyn
  that 
   he that is in helle shal have defaute of the sighte of god
  for certes the sighte of god is the lyf perdurable
  
   
 the derknesse of deeth
  been the synnes that the wrecched man hath doon
  whiche that destourben hym to see the face of god
  
   right as dooth a derk clowde bitwixe us and the sonne
  
   
 lond of misese
 
  by cause that ther been three maneres of defautes
  
   agayn three thynges that folk of this world han in this present lyf
  that is to seyn
  honours
  delices
  and richesses
  
   agayns honour
  have they in helle shame and confusioun
  
   for wel ye woot that men clepen honour the reverence that man doth to man
  but in helle is noon honour ne reverence
  
   for certes
  namoore reverence shal be doon there to a kyng than to a knave
  
   for which god seith by the prophete jeremye
  
 thilke folk that me despisen shul been in despit
 
  
  190 honour is eek cleped greet lordshipe
  ther shal no wight serven other
  but of harm 
  190a and torment
  honour is eek cleped greet dignytee and heighnesse
  but in helle shul they been al fortroden of develes
  
   and god seith
  
 the horrible develes shulle goon and comen upon the hevedes of the dampned folk
 
  and this is for as muche as 
   the hyer that they were in this present lyf
  the moore shulle they been abated and defouled in helle
  
   agayns the richesse of this world shul they han mysese of poverte
  and this poverte shal been in foure thynges
  
   in defaute of tresor
  of which that david seith
  
 the riche folk
  that embraceden and oneden al hire herte to tresor of this world
  
   shul slepe in the slepynge of deeth
  and nothyng ne shal they fynden in hir handes of al hir tresor
 
  
   and mooreover the myseyse of helle shal been in defaute of mete and drinke
  
   for god seith thus by moyses
  
 they shul been wasted with hunger
  and the briddes of helle shul devouren hem with bitter deeth
  
   and the galle of the dragon shal been hire drynke
  and the venym of the dragon hire morsels
 
  
   and forther over
  hire myseyse shal been in defaute of clothyng
  for they shulle be naked in body as of clothyng
  
   save the fyr in which they brenne
  and othere filthes
  
   and naked shul they been of soule
  as of alle manere vertues
  which that is the clothyng of the soule
  
   where been thanne the gaye robes
  and the softe shetes
  and the smale shertes
  
   loo
  what seith god of hem by the prophete ysaye
  that 
   
 under hem shul been strawed motthes
  and hire covertures shulle been of wormes of helle
 
  
   and forther over
  hir myseyse shal been in defaute of freendes
  
   for he nys nat povre that hath goode freendes
  but there is no frend
  
  200 for neither god ne no creature shal been freend to hem
  and everich of hem shal haten oother with deedly hate
  
   
 the sones and the doghtren shullen rebellen agayns fader and mooder
  and kynrede agayns kynrede
  and chiden 
   and despisen everich of hem oother bothe day and nyght
 
  as god seith by the prophete michias
  
   and the lovynge children
  that whilom loveden so flesshly everich oother
  wolden everich of hem eten oother if they myghte
  
   for how sholden they love hem togidre in the peyne of helle
  
   whan they hated everich of hem oother in the prosperitee of this lyf
  
   for truste wel
  hir flesshly love was deedly hate
  as seith the prophete david
  
 whoso that loveth wikkednesse
  he hateth his soule
 
  
   and whoso hateth his owene soule
  certes
  he may love noon oother wight in no manere
  
   and therfore
  in helle is no solas ne no freendshipe
  but evere the moore flesshly kynredes that been in helle
  
   the moore cursynges
  the more chidynges
  and the moore deedly hate ther is among hem
  
   and forther over
  they shul have defaute of alle manere delices
  
   for certes
  delices been after the appetites of the fyve wittes
  as sighte
  herynge
  smellynge
  savorynge
  and touchynge
  
   but in helle hir sighte shal be ful of derknesse and of smoke
  
   and therfore ful of teeres
  and hir herynge ful of waymentynge and of gryntynge of teeth
  as seith jhesu crist
  
   hir nose thirles shullen be ful of stynkynge stynk
  and
  as seith ysaye the prophete
  
 hir savoryng shal be ful of bitter galle
 
  
  210 and touchynge of al hir body ycovered with 
 fir 
  210a that nevere shal quenche and with wormes that nevere shul dyen
 
  
  210b as god seith by the mouth of ysaye
  
   and for as muche as they shul nat wene that they may dyen for peyne
  and by hir deeth flee fro peyne
  
   that may they understonden by the word of job
  that seith
  
 ther as is the shadwe of deeth
 
  
   certes
  a shadwe hath the liknesse of the thyng of which it is shadwe
  
   but shadwe is nat the same thyng of which it is shadwe
  
   right so fareth the peyne of helle
  it is lyk deeth for the horrible angwissh
  and why
  
   for it peyneth hem evere
  as though they sholde dye anon
  but certes
  they shal nat dye
  
   for
  as seith seint gregorie
  
 to wrecche caytyves shal be deeth withoute deeth
  and ende withouten ende
  and defaute withoute failynge
  
   for hir deeth shal alwey lyven
  and hir ende shal everemo bigynne
  and hir defaute shal nat faille
 
  
   and therfore seith seint john the evaungelist
  
 they shullen folwe deeth
  
   and they shul nat fynde hym
  and they shul desiren to dye
  and deeth shal flee fro hem
 
  
   and eek job seith that in helle is noon ordre of rule
  
   and al be it so that god hath creat alle thynges in right ordre
  and no thyng withouten ordre
  
   but alle thynges been ordeyned and nombred
  yet
  nathelees
  they that been dampned been nothyng in ordre
  ne holden noon ordre
  
   for the erthe ne shal bere hem no fruyt
  
  220 for
  as the prophete david seith
  
 god shal destroie the fruyt of the erthe as fro hem
  
  220a ne water ne shal yeve hem no moisture
  ne the eyr no refresshyng
  ne fyr no light
 
  
   for
  as seith seint basilie
  
 the brennynge of the fyr of this world shal god yeven in helle to hem that been dampned
  
   but the light and the cleernesse shal be yeven in hevene to his children
 
  
   right as the goode man yeveth flessh to his children and bones to his houndes
  
   and for they shullen have noon hope to escape
  seith seint job atte laste that 
 ther shal horrour and grisly drede dwellen withouten ende
 
  
   horrour is alwey drede of harm that is to come
  and this drede shal evere dwelle in the hertes of hem that been dampned
  
   and therfore han they lorn al hire hope
  for sevene causes
  
   first
  for god
  that is hir juge
  shal be withouten mercy to hem
  and they may nat plese hym ne noon of his halwes
  
   ne they ne may yeve no thyng for hir raunsoun
  
   ne they have no voys to speke to hym
  ne they may nat fle fro peyne
  
   ne they have no goodnesse in hem
  that they mowe shewe to delivere hem fro peyne
  
   and therfore seith salomon
  
 the wikked man dyeth
  and whan he is deed
  he shal have noon hope to escape fro peyne
 
  
   whoso thanne wolde wel understande thise peynes and bithynke hym weel that he hath deserved thilke peynes for his synnes
  
   certes
  he sholde have moore talent to siken and to wepe than for to syngen and to pleye
  
   for
  as that seith salomon
  
 whoso that hadde the science to knowe the peynes 
   that been establissed and ordeyned for synne
  he wolde make sorwe
 
  
  230 
 thilke science
 
  as seith seint augustyn
  
 maketh a man to waymenten in his herte
 
  
   the fourthe point that oghte maken a man to have contricion is the sorweful remembraunce of the good 
   that he hath left to doon heere in erthe
  and eek the good that he hath lorn
  
   soothly
  the goode werkes that he hath lost
  outher they been the goode werkes that he wroghte er he fel into deedly synne 
   or elles the goode werkes that he wroghte while he lay in synne
  
   soothly
  the goode werkes that he dide biforn that he fil in synne been al mortefied and astoned and dulled by the ofte synnyng
  
   the othere goode werkes
  that he wroghte whil he lay in deedly synne
  
   thei been outrely dede
  as to the lyf perdurable in hevene
  
   thanne thilke goode werkes that been mortefied by ofte synnyng
  
   whiche goode werkes he dide whil he was in charitee
  ne mowe nevere quyken agayn withouten verray penitence
  
   and therof seith god by the mouth of ezechiel
  that 
   
 if the rightful man returne agayn from his rightwisnesse and werke wikkednesse
  shal he lyve
 
  
   nay
  for alle the goode werkes that he hath wroght ne shul nevere been in remembraunce
  for he shal dyen in his synne
  
   and upon thilke chapitre seith seint gregorie thus
  that 
 we shulle understonde this principally
  
   that whan we doon deedly synne
  
   it is for noght thanne to rehercen or drawen into memorie the goode werkes that we han wroght biforn
 
  
  240 for certes
  in the werkynge of the deedly synne
  ther is no trust to no good werk that we han doon biforn
  
  240a that is to seyn
  as for to have therby the lyf perdurable in hevene
  
   but nathelees
  the goode werkes quyken agayn
  and comen agayn
  and helpen
  
   and availlen to have the lyf perdurable in hevene
  whan we han contricioun
  
   but soothly
  the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in deedly synne
  
   for as muche as they were doon in deedly synne
  they may nevere quyke agayn
  
   for certes
  thyng that nevere hadde lyf may nevere quykene
  and nathelees
  al be it that they ne availle noght to han the lyf perdurable
  
   yet availlen they to abregge of the peyne of helle
  or elles to geten temporal richesse
  
   or elles that god wole the rather enlumyne and lightne the herte of the synful man to have repentaunce
  
   and eek they availlen for to usen a man to doon goode werkes
  that the feend have the lasse power of his soule
  
   and thus the curteis lord jhesu crist ne wole that no good werk be lost
  for in somwhat it shal availle
  
   but
  for as muche as the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in good lyf been al mortefied by synne folwynge
  
   and eek sith that alle the goode werkes that men doon whil they been in deedly synne been outrely dede 
   as for to have the lyf perdurable
  
   wel may that man that no good werk ne dooth synge thilke newe frenshe song
  
 jay tout perdu mon temps et mon labour
 
  
   for certes
  synne bireveth a man bothe goodnesse of nature and eek the goodnesse of grace
  
  250 for soothly
  the grace of the hooly goost fareth lyk fyr
  that may nat been ydel
  
  250a for fyr fayleth anoon as it forleteth his wirkynge
  and right so grace fayleth anoon as it forleteth his werkynge
  
   then leseth the synful man the goodnesse of glorie
  that oonly is bihight to goode men that labouren and werken
  
   wel may he be sory thanne
  that oweth al his lif to god as longe as he hath lyved
  and eek as longe 
   as he shal lyve
  that no goodnesse ne hath to paye with his dette to god to whom he oweth al his lyf
  
   for trust wel
  
 he shal yeven acountes
 
  as seith seint bernard
  
   
 of alle the goodes that han be yeven hym in this present lyf
  and how he hath hem despended
  
    in  so muche that ther shal nat perisse an heer of his heed
  ne a moment of an houre 
   ne shal nat perisse of his tyme
  that he ne shal yeve of it a rekenyng
 
  
   the fifthe thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun 
   is remembrance of the passioun that oure lord jhesu crist suffred for oure synnes
  
   for
  as seith seint bernard
  
 whil that i lyve i shal have remembrance of the travailles that oure lord crist suffred in prechyng
  
   his werynesse in travaillyng
  his temptaciouns whan he fasted
  his longe wakynges 
   whan he preyde
  hise teeres whan that he weep for pitee of good peple
  
   the wo and the shame and the filthe that men seyden to hym
  of the foule spittyng that men spitte in his face
  
   of the buffettes that men yaven hym
  of the foule mowes
  and of the repreves that men to hym seyden
  
   of the nayles with whiche he was nayled to the croys
  
   and of al the remenant of his passioun that he suffred for my synnes
  and no thyng for his gilt
 
  
  260 and ye shul understonde that in mannes synne is every manere of ordre or ordinaunce turned up so doun
  
   for it is sooth that god
  and resoun
  and sensualitee
  and the body of man been so ordeyned 
   that everich of thise foure thynges sholde have lordshipe over that oother
  
   as thus
  god sholde have lordshipe over resoun
  and resoun over sensualitee
  and sensualitee over the body of man
  
   but soothly
  whan man synneth
  al this ordre or ordinaunce is turned up so doun
  
   and therfore thanne
  for as muche as the resoun of man ne wol nat be subget ne obeisant to god
  that is 
   his lord by right
  therfore leseth it the lordshipe that it sholde have over sensualitee
  and eek over the body of man
  
   and why
  for sensualitee rebelleth thanne agayns resoun
  and by that way leseth resoun the lordshipe over sensualitee and over the body
  
   for right as resoun is rebel to god
  right so is bothe sensualitee rebel to resoun and the body also
  
   and certes this disordinaunce and this rebellioun oure lord jhesu crist aboghte upon his precious body ful deere
  and herkneth in which wise
  
   for as muche thanne as resoun is rebel to god
  therfore is man worthy to have sorwe and to be deed
  
   this suffred oure lord jhesu crist for man
  after that he hadde be bitraysed of his disciple
  and distreyned and bounde 
   so that his blood brast out at every nayl of his handes
  as seith seint augustyn
  
  270 and forther over
  for as muchel as resoun of man ne wol nat daunte sensualitee whan it may
  
  270a therfore is man worthy to have shame
  and this suffred oure lord jhesu crist for man
  whan they spetten in his visage
  
   and forther over
  for as muchel thanne as the caytyf body of man is rebel bothe to resoun and to sensualitee
  
   therfore is it worthy the deeth
  
   and this suffred oure lord jhesu crist for man upon the croys
  
   where as ther was no part of his body free withouten greet peyne and bitter passioun
  
   and al this suffred jhesu crist
  that nevere forfeted
  and therfore resonably may be seyd of jhesu in this manere
  
   
 to muchel am i peyned for the thynges that i nevere deserved
  and to muche defouled for shendshipe that man is worthy to have
 
  
   and therfore may the synful man wel seye
  as seith seint bernard
  
   
 acursed be the bitternesse of my synne
  for which ther moste be suffred so muchel bitternesse
 
  
   for certes
  after the diverse  disordinaunces  of oure wikkednesses was the passioun of jhesu crist ordeyned in diverse thynges
  
   as thus
  certes
  synful mannes soule is bitraysed of the devel by coveitise of temporeel prosperitee
  and scorned by deceite 
   whan he cheseth flesshly delices
  and yet is it tormented by inpacience of adversitee and bispet by servage and subjeccioun of synne
  
   and atte laste it is slayn fynally
  
   for this disordinaunce of synful man was jhesu crist first bitraysed
  
   and after that was he bounde
  that cam for to unbynden us of synne and peyne
  
   thanne was he byscorned
  that oonly sholde han been honoured in alle thynges and of alle thynges
  
   thanne was his visage
  that oghte be desired to be seyn of al mankynde
  in which visage aungels desiren to looke
  vileynsly bispet
  
  280 thanne was he scourged
  that no thyng hadde agilt
  and finally
  thanne was he crucified and slayn
  
   thanne was acompliced the word of ysaye
  
 he was wounded for oure mysdedes and defouled for oure felonies
 
  
   now sith that jhesu crist took upon hymself the peyne of alle oure wikkednesses
  muchel oghte synful man wepen and biwayle
  
   that for his synnes goddes sone of hevene sholde al this peyne endure
  
   the sixte thyng that oghte moeve a man to contricioun is the hope of three thynges
  that is to seyn
  foryifnesse of synne
  
   and the yifte of grace wel for to do
  and the glorie of hevene
  with which god shal gerdone man for his goode dedes
  
   and for as muche as jhesu crist yeveth us thise yiftes of his largesse and of his sovereyn bountee
  
   therfore is he cleped jhesus nazarenus rex judeorum
  
   jhesus is to seyn 
 saveour
  or 
 salvacioun
 
  on whom men shul hope to have foryifnesse of synnes
  which that is proprely salvacioun of synnes
  
   and therfore seyde the aungel to joseph
  
 thou shalt clepen his name jhesus
  that shal saven his peple of hir synnes
 
  
   and heerof seith seint peter
  
 ther is noon oother name under hevene 
   that is yeve to any man
  by which a man may be saved
  but oonly jhesus
 
  
   nazarenus is as muche for to seye as 
 florisshynge
 
  in which a man shal hope that 
   he that yeveth hym remissioun of synnes shal yeve hym eek grace wel for to do
  
   for in the flour is hope of fruyt in tyme comynge
  and in foryifnesse of synnes hope of grace wel for to do
  
   
 i was atte dore of thyn herte
 
  seith jhesus
  
 and cleped for to entre
  he that openeth to me shal have foryifnesse of synne
  
  290 i wol entre into hym by my grace and soupe with hym
 
  by the goode werkes that he shal doon
  
  290a whiche werkes been the foode of god
  
 and he shal soupe with me
  by the grete joye that i shal yeven hym
  
   thus shal man hope
  for his werkes of penaunce that god shal yeven hym his regne
  as he bihooteth hym in the gospel
  
   now shal a man understonde in which manere shal been his contricioun
  i seye that it shal been universal and total
  
   this is to seyn
  a man shal be verray repentaunt for alle his synnes that he hath doon 
   in delit of his thoght
  for delit is ful perilous
  
   for ther been two manere of consentynges
  that oon of hem is cleped consentynge of affeccioun
  
   whan a man is moeved to do synne
  and deliteth hym longe for to thynke on that synne
  
   and his reson aperceyveth it wel that it is synne agayns the lawe of god
  
   and yet his resoun refreyneth nat his foul delit or talent
  though he se wel apertly that it is agayns the reverence of god
  
   although his resoun ne consente noght to doon that synne in dede
  
   yet seyn somme doctours that swich delit that dwelleth longe
  it is ful perilous
  al be it nevere so lite
  
   and also a man sholde sorwe namely for al that evere he hath desired agayn the lawe of god 
   with parfit consentynge of his resoun
  for therof is no doute
  that it is deedly synne in consentynge
  
   for certes
  ther is no deedly synne that it nas first in mannes thought 
   and after that in his delit
  and so forth into consentynge and into dede
  
   wherfore i seye that many men ne repenten hem nevere of swiche thoghtes and delites
  
   ne nevere shryven hem of it
  but oonly of the dede of grete synnes outward
  
   wherfore i seye that swiche wikked delites and wikked thoghtes been subtile bigileres of hem that shullen be dampned
  
  300 mooreover
  man oghte to sorwe for his wikkede wordes as wel as for his wikkede dedes
  
  300a for certes
  the repentaunce of a synguler synne
  and nat repente of alle his othere synnes
  
  300b or elles repenten hym of alle his othere synnes and nat of a synguler synne
  may nat availle
  
   for certes
  god almyghty is al good
  and therfore he foryeveth al or elles right noght
  
   and heerof seith seint augustyn
  
   
 i wot certeynly that god is enemy to everich synnere
 
  and how thanne
  
   he that observeth o synne
  shal he have foryifnesse of the remenaunt of his othere synnes
  nay
  
   and forther over
  contricioun sholde be wonder sorweful and angwissous
  and therfore yeveth hym god pleynly his mercy
  
   and therfore
  whan my soule was angwissous withinne me
  i hadde remembrance of god that my preyere myghte come to hym
  
   forther over
  contricioun moste be continueel
  and that man have stedefast purpos to shriven hym
  and for to amenden hym of his lyf
  
   for soothly
  whil contricioun lasteth
  man may evere have hope of foryifnesse
  
   and of this comth hate of synne
  that destroyeth synne
  bothe in himself and eek in oother folk at his power
  
   for which seith david
  
 ye that loven god
  hateth wikkednesse
 
  
   for trusteth wel
  to love god is for to love that he loveth
  and hate that he hateth
  
   the laste thyng that men shal understonde in contricioun is this
  
   wherof avayleth contricioun
  i seye that somtyme contricioun delivereth a man fro synne
  
   of which that david seith
  
 i seye
 
  quod david  that is to seyn
  
   i purposed fermely  
 to shryve me
  and thow
  lord
  relessedest my synne
 
  
  310 and right so as contricion availleth noght withouten sad purpos of shrifte
  
  310a if man have oportunitee
  right so litel worth is shrifte or satisfaccioun withouten contricioun
  
   and mooreover contricion destroyeth the prisoun of helle
  and maketh wayk and fieble alle the strengthes of the develes
  
   and restoreth the yiftes of the hooly goost and of alle goode vertues
  
   and it clenseth the soule of synne
  and delivereth the soule fro the peyne of helle
  and fro the compaignye of the devel
  
   and fro the servage of synne
  and restoreth it to alle goodes espirituels
  and to the compaignye and communyoun of hooly chirche
  
   and forther over
  it maketh hym that whilom was sone of ire to be sone of grace
  
   and alle thise thynges been preved by hooly writ
  
   and therfore
  he that wolde sette his entente to thise thynges
  he were ful wys
  
   for soothly he ne sholde nat thanne in al his lyf have corage to synne
  
   but yeven his body and al his herte to the service of jhesu crist
  and therof doon hym hommage
  
   for soothly oure sweete lord jhesu crist hath spared us so debonairly in oure folies that 
   if he ne hadde pitee of mannes soule
  a sory song we myghten alle synge
  
   the seconde partie of penitence is confessioun
  that is signe of contricioun
  
   now shul ye understonde what is confessioun
  
   and wheither it oghte nedes be doon or noon
  and whiche thynges been covenable to verray confessioun
  
   first shaltow understonde that confessioun is verray shewynge of synnes to the preest
  
   this is to seyn 
 verray
 
  for he moste confessen hym of alle the condiciouns that bilongen to his synne
  as ferforth as he kan
  
  320 al moot be seyd
  and no thyng excused ne hyd ne forwrapped
  and noght avaunte thee of thy goode werkes
  
   and forther over
  it is necessarie to understonde whennes that synnes spryngen
  and how they encreessen
  and whiche they been
  
   of the spryngynge of synnes seith seint paul in this wise
  that 
 right as by a man synne entred first into this world
  
   and thurgh that synne deeth
  right so thilke deeth entred into alle men that synneden
 
  
   and this man was adam
  by whom synne entred into this world
  whan he brak the comaundementz of god
  
   and therfore
  he that first was so myghty that he sholde nat have dyed
  bicam swich oon that he moste nedes dye
  
   wheither he wolde or noon
  and al his progenye in this world
  that in thilke man synneden
  
   looke that in th  estaat of innocence
  whan adam and eve naked weren in paradys
  and nothyng ne hadden shame of hir nakednesse
  
   how that the serpent
  that was moost wily of alle othere beestes that god hadde maked
  seyde to the womman
  
   
 why comaunded god to yow ye sholde nat eten of every tree in paradys
 
  
   the womman answerde
  
 of the fruyt
 
  quod she
  
 of the trees in paradys we feden us
  
   but soothly
  of the fruyt of the tree that is in the myddel of paradys
  god forbad us for to ete
  
   ne nat touchen it
  lest per aventure we sholde dyen
 
  
   the serpent seyde to the womman
  
 nay
  nay
  ye shul nat dyen of deeth
  for sothe
  god woot that 
   what day that ye eten therof
  youre eyen shul opene and ye shul been as goddes
  knowynge good and harm
 
  
   the womman thanne saugh that the tree was good to feedyng
  and fair to the eyen
  and delitable to the sighte
  
   she took of the fruyt of the tree
  and eet it
  and yaf to hire housbonde
  
   and he eet
  and anoon the eyen of hem bothe openeden
  
  330 and whan that they knewe that they were naked
  they sowed of fige leves a maner of breches to hiden hire membres
  
   there may ye seen that deedly synne hath
  first
  suggestion of the feend
  as sheweth heere by the naddre
  
   and afterward
  the delit of the flessh
  as sheweth heere by eve
  and after that
  the consentynge of resoun
  as sheweth heere by adam
  
   for trust wel
  though so were that the feend tempted eve    that is to seyn
  the flessh    
   and the flessh hadde delit in the beautee of the fruyt defended
  yet certes
  til that resoun    that is to seyn
  adam    
   consented to the etynge of the fruyt
  yet stood he in th  estaat of innocence
  
   of thilke adam tooke we thilke synne original
  
   for of hym flesshly descended be we alle
  and engendred of vile and corrupt mateere
  
   and whan the soule is put in oure body
  right anon is contract original synne
  
   and that that was erst but oonly peyne of concupiscence is afterward bothe peyne and synne
  
   and therfore be we alle born sones of wratthe and of dampnacioun perdurable
  if it nere baptesme that we receyven
  
   which bynymeth us the culpe
  but for sothe
  the peyne dwelleth with us
  as to temptacioun
  which peyne highte concupiscence
  
   and this concupiscence
  whan it is wrongfully disposed or ordeyned in man
  it maketh hym coveite
  by coveitise of flessh
  
   flesshly synne
  by sighte of his eyen as to erthely thynges
  and eek coveitise of hynesse by pride of herte
  
   now
  as for to speken of the firste coveitise
  that is concupiscence
  after the lawe of oure membres 
   that weren lawefulliche ymaked and by rightful juggement of god
  
   i seye
  forasmuche as man is nat obeisaunt to god
  that is his lord
  
   therfore is the flessh to hym disobeisaunt thurgh concupiscence
  which yet is cleped norrissynge of synne and occasioun of synne
  
   therfore
  al the while that a man hath in hym the peyne of concupiscence
  
   it is impossible but he be tempted somtime and moeved in his flessh to synne
  
  340 and this thyng may nat faille as longe as he lyveth
  
  340a it may wel wexe fieble and faille by vertu of baptesme and by the grace of god thurgh penitence
  
   but fully ne shal it nevere quenche
  that he ne shal som tyme be moeved in hymself
  
   but if he were al refreyded by siknesse
  or by malefice of sorcerie
  or colde drynkes
  
   for lo
  what seith seint paul
  
 the flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit
  and the spirit agayn the flessh
  
   they been so contrarie and so stryven that a man may nat alway doon as he wolde
 
  
   the same seint paul
  after his grete penaunce in water and in lond    
   in water by nyght and by day in greet peril and in greet peyne
  
   in lond
  in famyne and thurst
  in coold and cloothlees
  and ones stoned almoost to the deeth 
      yet seyde he
  
 allas
  i caytyf man
  who shal delivere me fro the prisoun of my caytyf body
 
  
   and seint jerome
  whan he longe tyme hadde woned in desert
  where as he hadde no compaignye but of wilde beestes
  
   where as he ne hadde no mete but herbes
  and water to his drynke
  ne no bed but the naked erthe
  
   for which his flessh was blak as an ethiopeen for heete
  and ny destroyed for coold
  
   yet seyde he that 
 the brennynge of lecherie boyled in al his body
 
  
   wherfore i woot wel sykerly that they been deceyved that seyn that they ne be nat tempted in hir body
  
   witnesse on seint jame the apostel
  that seith that 
 every wight is tempted in his owene concupiscence
 
  that is to seyn
  
   that everich of us hath matere and occasioun to be tempted of the norissynge of synne that is in his body
  
   and therfore seith seint john the evaungelist
  
 if that we seyn that we be withoute synne
  
   we deceyve us selve
  and trouthe is nat in us
 
  
  350 now shal ye understonde in what manere that synne wexeth or encreesseth in man
  
  350a the firste thyng is thilke norissynge of synne of which i spak biforn
  thilke flesshly concupiscence
  
   and after that comth the subjeccioun of the devel    
   this is to seyn
  the develes bely
  with which he bloweth in man the fir of flesshly concupiscence
  
   and after that
  a man bithynketh hym wheither he wol doon or no thilke thing to which he is tempted
  
   and thanne
  if that a man withstonde and weyve the firste entisynge of his flessh and of the feend
  
   thanne is it no synne
  and if it so be that he do nat so
  thanne feeleth he anoon a flambe of delit
  
   and thanne is it good to be war and kepen hym wel
  
   or elles he wol falle anon into consentynge of synne
  and thanne wol he do it
  if he may have tyme and place
  
   and of this matere seith moyses by the devel in this manere
  
 the feend seith
  
    i wole chace and pursue the man by wikked suggestioun
  and i wole hente hym by moevynge or stirynge of synne
  
   and i wol departe my prise or my praye by deliberacioun
  and my lust shal been acompliced in delit
  
   i wol drawe my swerd in consentyng
  
     
   for certes
  right as a swerd departeth a thyng in two peces
  right so consentynge departeth god fro man    
   
  and thanne wol i sleen hym with myn hand in dede of synne 
  thus seith the feend
 
  
   for certes
  thanne is a man al deed in soule
  
   and thus is synne acompliced by temptacioun
  by delit
  and by consentynge
  and thanne is the synne cleped actueel
  
   for sothe
  synne is in two maneres
  outher it is venial or deedly synne
  
   soothly
  whan man loveth any creature moore than jhesu crist oure creatour
  thanne is it deedly synne
  
   and venial synne is it
  if man love jhesu crist lasse than hym oghte
  
   for sothe
  the dede of this venial synne is ful perilous
  
   for it amenuseth the love that men sholde han to god moore and moore
  
  360 and therfore
  if a man charge hymself with manye swiche venial synnes
  
  360a certes
  but if so be that he somtyme descharge hym of hem by shrifte
  
  360b they mowe ful lightly amenuse in hym al the love that he hath to jhesu crist
  
   and in this wise skippeth venial into deedly synne
  for certes
  the moore that a man chargeth his soule with venial synnes
  
   the moore is he enclyned to fallen into deedly synne
  
   and therfore lat us nat be necligent to deschargen us of venial synnes
  for the proverbe seith that 
 manye smale maken a greet
 
  
   and herkne this ensample
  a greet wawe of the see comth som tyme with so greet a violence that it drencheth the ship
  
   and the same harm doon som tyme the smale dropes of water
  that entren thurgh a litel crevace into the thurrok
  
   and in the botme of the ship
  if men be so necligent that they ne descharge hem nat by tyme
  
   and therfore
  although ther be a difference bitwixe thise two causes of drenchynge
  algates the ship is dreynt
  
   right so fareth it somtyme of deedly synne
  and of anoyouse veniale synnes
  
   whan they multiplie in a man so greetly that  the love of  thilke worldly thynges that he loveth
  
   thurgh whiche he synneth venyally
  is as greet in his herte as the love of god
  or moore
  
   and therfore
  the love of every thyng that is nat biset in god
  ne doon principally for goddes sake
  
   although that a man love it lasse than god
  yet is it venial synne
  
   and deedly synne whan the love of any thyng weyeth in the herte of man as muchel as the love of god
  or moore
  
   
 deedly synne
 
  as seith seint augustyn
  
 is whan a man turneth his herte fro god
  
   which that is verray sovereyn bountee
  that may nat chaunge
  and yeveth his herte to thyng that may chaunge and flitte
 
  
   and certes
  that is every thyng save god of hevene
  
   for sooth is that if a man yeve his love
  the which that he oweth al to god with al his herte
  unto a creature
  
   certes
  as muche of his love as he yeveth to thilke creature
  so muche he bireveth fro god
  
  370 and therfore dooth he synne
  for he that is dettour to god ne yeldeth nat to god al his dette
  
  370a that is to seyn
  al the love of his herte
  
   now sith man understondeth generally which is venial synne
  thanne is it covenable to tellen specially of synnes whiche that many 
   a man peraventure ne demeth hem nat synnes
  and ne shryveth him nat of the same thynges
  and yet natheless they been synnes 
   soothly
  as thise clerkes writen
  this is to seyn
  that at every tyme that a man eteth or drynketh 
   moore than suffiseth to the sustenaunce of his body
  in certein he dooth synne
  
   and eek whan he speketh moore than it nedeth
  it is synne
  eke whan he herkneth nat benignely the compleint of the povre
  
   eke whan he is in heele of body and wol nat faste whan other folk faste
  withouten cause resonable
  
   eke whan he slepeth moore than nedeth
  or whan he comth by thilke enchesoun to late to chirche
  or to othere werkes of charite
  
   eke whan he useth his wyf withouten sovereyn desir of engendrure to the honour of god 
   or for the entente to yelde to his wyf the dette of his body
  
   eke whan he wol nat visite the sike and the prisoner
  if he may
  
   eke if he love wyf or child
  or oother worldly thyng
  moore than resoun requireth
  
   eke if he flatere or blandise moore than hym oghte for any necessitee
  
   eke if he amenuse or withdrawe the almesse of the povre
  
   eke if he apparailleth his mete moore deliciously than nede is
  or ete it to hastily by likerousnesse
  
   eke if he tale vanytees at chirche or at goddes service
  or that he be a talker 
   of ydel wordes of folye or of vileynye
  for he shal yelden acountes of it at the day of doom
  
   eke whan he biheteth or assureth to do thynges that he may nat parfourne
  
   eke whan that he by lightnesse or folie mysseyeth or scorneth his neighebor
  
  380 eke whan he hath any wikked suspecioun of thyng ther he ne woot of it no soothfastnesse
  
   thise thynges
  and mo withoute nombre
  been synnes
  as seith seint augustyn
  
   now shal men understonde that
  al be it so that noon erthely man may eschue alle venial synnes
  
   yet may he refreyne hym by the brennynge love that he hath to oure lord jhesu crist
  
   and by preyeres and confessioun and othere goode werkes
  so that it shal but litel greve
  
   for
  as seith seint augustyn
  
 if a man love god in swich manere that al that evere he dooth 
   is in the love of god and for the love of god verraily
  for he brenneth in the love of god
  
   looke how muche that a drope of water that falleth in a fourneys ful of fyr anoyeth 
   or greveth
  so muche anoyeth a venial synne unto a man that is parfit in the love of jhesu crist
 
  
   men may also refreyne venial synne by receyvynge worthily of the precious body of jhesu crist
  
   by receyvynge eek of hooly water
  by almesdede
  by general confessioun of confiteor at masse and at complyn
  
   and by blessynge of bisshopes and of preestes
  and by oothere goode werkes
  
   now is it bihovely thyng to telle whiche been the sevene deedly synnes
  
   this is to seyn
  chieftaynes of synnes
  alle they renne in o lees
  but in diverse manneres
  
   now been they cleped chieftaynes
  for as muche as they been chief and spryng of alle othere synnes
  
   of the roote of thise sevene synnes
  thanne
  is pride the general roote of alle harmes
  
   for of this roote spryngen certein braunches
  as ire
  envye
  accidie or slewthe
  avarice or coveitise  to commune understondynge 
  glotonye
  and lecherye
  
   and everich of thise chief synnes hath his braunches and his twigges
  as shal be declared in hire chapitres folwynge
  
  390 and thogh so be that no man kan outrely telle the nombre of the twigges and of the harmes that cometh of pride
  
  390a yet wol i shewe a partie of hem
  as ye shul understonde
  
   ther is inobedience
  avauntynge
  ypocrisie
  despit
  arrogance
  inpudence
  swellynge of herte
  insolence
  elacioun
  inpacience
  strif
  contumacie
  presumpcioun
  irreverence
  pertinacie
  veyneglorie
  
   and many another twig that i kan nat declare
  
   inobedient is he that disobeyeth for despit to the comandementz of god
  and to his sovereyns
  and to his goostly fader
  
   avauntour is he that bosteth of the harm or of the bountee that he hath doon
  
   ypocrite is he that hideth to shewe hym swich as he is and sheweth hym swich as he noght is
  
   despitous is he that hath desdeyn of his neighebor    
   that is to seyn
  of his evene cristene    or hath despit to doon that hym oghte to do
  
   arrogant is he that thynketh that he hath thilke bountees in hym that he hath noght
  
   or weneth that he sholde have hem by his desertes
  or elles he demeth that he be that he nys nat
  
   inpudent is he that for his pride hath no shame of his synnes
  
   swellynge of herte is whan a man rejoyseth hym of harm that he hath doon
  
   insolent is he that despiseth in his juggement alle othere folk
  
   as to regard of his value
  and of his konnyng
  and of his spekyng
  and of his beryng
  
  400 elacioun is whan he ne may neither suffre to have maister ne felawe
  
   inpacient is he that wol nat been ytaught ne undernome of his vice
  and by strif werreieth trouthe wityngly
  and deffendeth his folye
  
   contumax is he that thurgh his indignacioun is agayns everich auctoritee or power of hem that been his sovereyns
  
   presumpcioun is whan a man undertaketh an emprise that hym oghte nat do
  or elles that he may nat do
  
   and this is called surquidrie
  irreverence is whan men do nat honour there as hem oghte to doon
  and waiten to be reverenced
  
   pertinacie is whan man deffendeth his folie and trusteth to muchel to his owene wit
  
   veyneglorie is for to have pompe and delit in his temporeel hynesse
  and glorifie hym in this worldly estaat
  
   janglynge is whan a man speketh to muche biforn folk
  and clappeth as a mille
  and taketh no keep what he seith
  
   and yet is ther a privee spece of pride that waiteth first to be salewed 
   er he wole salewe
  al be he lasse worth than that oother is
  peraventure
  
   and eek he waiteth or desireth to sitte
  or elles to goon above hym in the wey
  
   or kisse pax
  or been encensed
  or goon to offryng biforn his neighebor
  
   and swiche semblable thynges
  agayns his duetee
  peraventure
  but that he hath his herte 
   and his entente in swich a proud desir to be magnified and honoured biforn the peple
  
   now been ther two maneres of pride
  that oon of hem is withinne the herte of man
  and that oother is withoute
  
  410 of whiche
  soothly
  thise forseyde thynges
  and mo than i have seyd
  apertenen to pride that is in the herte of man
  
  410a and that othere speces of pride been withoute
  
   but natheles that oon of thise speces of pride is signe of that oother
  
   right as the gaye leefsel atte taverne is signe of the wyn that is in the celer
  
   and this is in manye thynges
  as in speche and contenaunce
  and in outrageous array of clothyng
  
   for certes
  if ther ne hadde be no synne in clothyng
  
   crist wolde nat so soone have noted and spoken of the clothyng of thilke riche man in the gospel
  
   and
  as seith seint gregorie
  that 
 precious clothyng is cowpable for the derthe of it
  and for his softenesse
  
   and for his strangenesse and degisynesse
  and for the superfluitee
  or for the inordinat scantnesse of it
 
  
   allas
  may man nat seen
  as in oure dayes
  the synful costlewe array of clothynge
  
   and namely in to muche superfluite
  or elles in to desordinat scantnesse
  
   as to the first synne
  that is in superfluitee of clothynge
  which that maketh it so deere
  to harm of the peple
  
   nat oonly the cost of embrowdynge
  the degise endentynge or barrynge
  owndynge
  palynge
  wyndynge or bendynge
  and semblable wast of clooth in vanitee
  
   but ther is also costlewe furrynge in hir gownes
  so muche pownsonynge of chisels to maken holes
  so muche daggynge of sheres
  
   forth with the superfluitee in lengthe of the forseide gownes
  trailynge in the dong and in the mire
  on horse and eek on foote
  
   as wel of man as of womman
  that al thilke trailyng is verraily as in effect wasted
  consumed
  thredbare
  and roten with donge
  
   rather than it is yeven to the povre
  to greet damage of the forseyde povre folk
  
  420 and that in sondry wise
  this is to seyn that the moore that clooth is wasted
  
  420a the moore moot it coste to the peple for the scarsnesse
  
   and forther over
  if so be that they wolde yeven swich pownsoned and dagged clothyng to the povre folk
  
   it is nat convenient to were for hire estaat
  ne suffisant to beete hire necessitee
  to kepe hem fro the distemperance of the firmament
  
   upon that oother side
  to speken of the horrible disordinat scantnesse of clothyng
  as been thise kutted sloppes
  or haynselyns
  
   that thurgh hire shortnesse ne covere nat the shameful membres of man
  to wikked entente
  
   allas
  somme of hem shewen the boce of hir shap
  and the horrible swollen membres
  
   that semeth lik the maladie of hirnia
  in the wrappynge of hir hoses
  
   and eek the buttokes of hem faren as it were the hyndre part of a she ape in the fulle of the moone
  
   and mooreover
  the wrecched swollen membres that they shewe thurgh disgisynge
  
   in departynge of hire hoses in whit and reed
  semeth that half hir shameful privee membres weren flayne
  
   and if so be that they departen hire hoses in othere colours
  
   as is whit and blak
  or whit and blew
  or blak and reed
  and so forth
  
   thanne semeth it
  as by variaunce of colour
  that half the partie of hire privee membres were corrupt 
   by the fir of seint antony
  or by cancre
  or by oother swich meschaunce
  
   of the hyndre part of hir buttokes
  it is ful horrible for to see
  
   for certes
  in that partie of hir body ther as they purgen hir stynkynge ordure
  
   that foule partie shewe they to the peple prowdly in despit of honestitee
  
   which honestitee that jhesu crist and his freendes observede to shewen in hir lyve
  
  430 now
  as of the outrageous array of wommen
  god woot that though the visages of somme of hem seme ful chaast and debonaire
  
  430a yet notifie they in hire array of atyr likerousnesse and pride
  
   i sey nat that honestitee in clothynge of man or womman is uncovenable
  but certes the superfluitee or disordinat scantitee of clothynge is reprevable
  
   also the synne of aornement or of apparaille is in thynges that apertenen to ridynge
  
   as in to manye delicat horses that been hoolden for delit
  that been so faire
  fatte
  and costlewe
  
   and also in many a vicious knave that is sustened by cause of hem
  and in to curious harneys
  
   as in sadeles
  in crouperes
  peytrels
  and bridles covered with precious clothyng
  and riche barres and plates of gold and of silver
  
   for which god seith by zakarie the prophete
  
 i wol confounde the rideres of swiche horses
 
  
   this folk taken litel reward of the ridynge of goddes sone of hevene
  and of his harneys whan he rood upon the asse
  
   and ne hadde noon oother harneys but the povre clothes of his disciples
  
   ne we ne rede nat that evere he rood on oother beest
  
   i speke this for the synne of superfluitee
  and nat for resonable honestitee
  whan reson it requireth
  
   and forther over
  certes
  pride is greetly notified in holdynge of greet meynee
  whan they be of litel profit or of right no profit
  
   and namely whan that meynee is felonous and damageous to the peple by hardynesse of heigh lordshipe or by wey of offices
  
   for certes
  swiche lordes sellen thanne hir lordshipe to the devel of helle
  whanne they sustenen the wikkednesse of hir meynee
  
  440 or elles
  whan this folk of lowe degree
  as thilke that holden hostelries
  sustenen the thefte of hire hostilers
  
  440a and that is in many manere of deceites
  
   thilke manere of folk been the flyes that folwen the hony
  
   or elles the houndes that folwen the careyne
  swich forseyde folk stranglen spiritually hir lordshipes
  
   for which thus seith david the prophete
  
   
 wikked deeth moote come upon thilke lordshipes
  and god yeve that they moote descenden into helle al doun
  
   for in hire houses been iniquitees and shrewednesses and nat god of hevene
 
  
   and certes
  but if they doon amendement
  right as god yaf his benysoun to  laban  by the service of jacob
  
   and to  pharao  by the service of joseph
  right so god wol yeve his malisoun 
   to swiche lordshipes as sustenen the wikkednesse of hir servauntz
  but they come to amendement
  
   pride of the table appeereth eek ful ofte
  for certes
  riche men been cleped to festes
  and povre folk been put awey and rebuked
  
   also in excesse of diverse metes and drynkes
  and namely swich manere bake metes and dissh metes
  brennynge of wilde fir 
   and peynted and castelled with papir
  and semblable wast
  so that it is abusioun for to thynke
  
   and eek in to greet preciousnesse of vessel and curiositee of mynstralcie
  by whiche a man is stired the moore to delices of luxurie
  
   if so be that he sette his herte the lasse upon oure lord jhesu crist
  certeyn it is a synne
  
   and certeinly the delices myghte been so grete in this caas that man myghte lightly falle by hem into deedly synne
  
   the especes that sourden of pride
  soothly whan they sourden of malice ymagined
  avised
  and forncast
  
   or elles of usage
  been deedly synnes
  it is no doute
  
   and whan they sourden by freletee unavysed
  and sodeynly withdrawen 
   ayeyn
  al been they grevouse synnes
  i gesse that they ne been nat deedly
  
  450 now myghte men axe wherof that pride sourdeth and spryngeth
  and i seye
  
  450a somtyme it spryngeth of the goodes of nature
  and somtyme of the goodes of fortune
  and somtyme of the goodes of grace
  
   certes
  the goodes of nature stonden outher in goodes of body or in goodes of soule
  
   certes
  goodes of body been heele of body
  strengthe
  delivernesse
  beautee
  gentrice
  franchise
  
   goodes of nature of the soule been good wit
  sharp understondynge
  subtil engyn
  vertu natureel
  good memorie
  
   goodes of fortune been richesse
  hyghe degrees of lordshipes
  preisynges of the peple
  
   goodes of grace been science
  power to suffre spiritueel travaille
  benignitee
  vertuous contemplacioun
  withstondynge of temptacioun
  and semblable thynges
  
   of whiche forseyde goodes
  certes it is a ful greet folye a man to priden hym in any of hem alle
  
   now as for to speken of goodes of nature
  
   god woot that somtyme we han hem in nature as muche to oure damage as to oure profit
  
   as for to speken of heele of body
  certes it passeth ful lightly
  
   and eek it is ful ofte enchesoun of the siknesse of oure soule
  
   for
  god woot
  the flessh is a ful greet enemy to the soule
  
   and therfore
  the moore that the body is hool
  the moore be we in peril to falle
  
   eke for to pride hym in his strengthe of body
  it is an heigh folye
  
   for certes
  the flessh coveiteth agayn the spirit
  and ay the moore strong that the flessh is
  the sorier may the soule be
  
  460 and over al this
  strengthe of body and worldly hardynesse causeth ful ofte many a man to peril and meschaunce
  
   eek for to pride hym of his gentrie is ful greet folie
  for 
   ofte tyme the gentrie of the body binymeth the gentrie of the soule
  
   and eek we ben alle of o fader and of o mooder
  
   and alle we been of o nature
  roten and corrupt
  bothe riche and povre
  
   for sothe
  o manere gentrie is for to preise
  that apparailleth mannes corage with vertues and moralitees
  and maketh hym cristes child
  
   for truste wel that over what man that synne hath maistrie
  he is a verray cherl to synne
  
   now been ther generale signes of gentillesse
  as eschewynge of vice and ribaudye and servage of synne
  in word
  in werk
  and contenaunce
  
   and usynge vertu
  curteisye
  and clennesse
  and to be liberal    
   that is to seyn
  large by mesure
  for thilke that passeth mesure is folie and synne
  
   another is to remembre hym of bountee that he of oother folk hath receyved
  
   another is to be benigne to his goode subgetis
  wherfore seith senek
  
   
 ther is no thing moore covenable to a man of heigh estaat than debonairetee and pitee
  
   and therfore thise flyes that men clepen bees
  whan they maken hir kyng
  
   they chesen oon that hath no prikke wherwith he may stynge
 
  
   another is
  a man to have a noble herte and a diligent to attayne to heighe vertuouse thynges
  
  470 now certes
  a man to pride hym in the goodes of grace is eek an outrageous folie
  for thilke 
  470a yifte of grace that sholde have turned hym to goodnesse and to medicine
  turneth hym to venym and to confusioun
  as seith seint gregorie
  
   certes also
  whoso prideth hym in the goodes of fortune
  he is a ful greet fool
  
   for somtyme is a man a greet lord by the morwe
  that is a caytyf and a wrecche er it be nyght
  
   and somtyme the richesse of a man is cause of his deth
  
   somtyme the delices of a man ben cause of the grevous maladye thurgh which he dyeth
  
   certes
  the commendacioun of the peple is somtyme ful fals and ful brotel for to triste
  this day they preyse
  tomorwe they blame
  
   god woot
  desir to have commendacioun eek of the peple hath caused deeth to many a bisy man
  
   now sith that so is that ye han understonde what is pride
  
   and whiche been the speces of it
  and whennes pride sourdeth and spryngeth
  
   now shul ye understonde which is the remedie agayns the synne of pride
  and that is humylitee
  or mekenesse
  
   that is a vertu thurgh which a man hath verray knoweleche of hymself
  and holdeth of hymself no pris ne deyntee
  
   as in regard of his desertes
  considerynge evere his freletee
  
   now been ther three maneres of humylitee
  as humylitee in herte
  another humylitee is in his mouth
  the thridde in his werkes
  
   the humilitee in herte is in foure maneres
  that oon is whan a man holdeth hymself as noght worth biforn god of hevene
  
   another is whan he ne despiseth noon oother man
  
  480 the thridde is whan he rekketh nat
  though men holde hym noght worth
  the ferthe is whan he nys nat sory of his humiliacioun
  
   also the humilitee of mouth is in foure thynges
  
   in attempree speche
  and in humblesse of speche
  and whan he biknoweth with his owene mouth 
   that he is swich as hym thynketh that he is in his herte
  
   another is whan he preiseth the bountee of another man
  and nothyng therof amenuseth
  
   humilitee eek in werkes is in foure maneres
  the firste is whan he putteth othere men biforn hym
  
   the seconde is to chese the loweste place over al
  the thridde is gladly to assente to good conseil
  
   the ferthe is to stonde gladly to the award of his sovereyns
  
   or of hym that is in hyer degree
  certein
  this is a greet werk of humylitee
  
   after pride wol i speken of the foule synne of envye
  which that is
  as by the word of the philosophre
  
   
 sorwe of oother mannes prosperitee
 
  and after the word of seint augustyn
  it is 
 sorwe 
   of oother mennes wele
  and joye of othere mennes harm
 
  
   this foule synne is platly agayns the hooly goost
  al be it so that every synne is agayns the hooly goost
  
   yet nathelees
  for as muche as bountee aperteneth proprely to the hooly goost
  and envye comth proprely of malice
  
   therfore it is proprely agayn the bountee of the hooly goost
  
   now hath malice two speces
  that is to seyn
  hardnesse of herte in wikkednesse
  
   or elles the flessh of man is so blynd that he considereth nat that he is in synne 
   or rekketh nat that he is in synne
  which is the hardnesse of the devel
  
   that oother spece of malice is whan a man werreyeth trouthe
  whan he woot that it is trouthe
  
   and eek whan he werreyeth the grace that god hath yeve to his neighebor
  and al this is by envye
  
   certes
  thanne is envye the worste synne that is
  for soothly
  alle othere synnes been somtyme oonly agayns o special vertu
  
   but certes envye is agayns alle vertues and agayns alle goodnesses
  
   for it is sory of alle the bountees of his neighebor
  and in this manere it is divers from alle othere synnes
  
  490 for wel unnethe is ther any synne that it ne hath som delit in itself
  
  490a save oonly envye
  that evere hath in itself angwissh and sorwe
  
   the speces of envye been thise
  ther is first
  sorwe of oother mannes goodnesse and of his prosperitee
  
   and prosperitee is kyndely matere of joye
  thanne is envye a synne agayns kynde
  
   the seconde spece of envye is joye of oother mannes harm
  
   and that is proprely lyk to the devel
  that evere rejoyseth hym of mannes harm
  
   of thise two speces comth bakbityng
  and this synne of bakbityng or detraccion hath certeine speces
  as thus
  
   som man preiseth his neighebor by a wikked entente
  
   for he maketh alwey a wikked knotte atte laste ende
  alwey he maketh a 
 but
  atte laste ende
  
   that is digne of moore blame than worth is al the preisynge
  
   the seconde spece is that if a man be good and dooth or seith a thing to good entente
  
   the bakbitere wol turne al thilke goodnesse up so doun to his shrewed entente
  
   the thridde is to amenuse the bountee of his neighebor
  
   the fourthe spece of bakbityng is this
  that if men speke goodnesse of a man
  thanne wol the bakbitere seyn
  
   
 parfey
  swich a man is yet bet than he
 
  in dispreisynge of hym that men preise
  
   the fifte spece is this
  for to consente gladly and herkne gladly to the harm that men speke of oother folk
  
   this synne is ful greet and ay encreesseth after the wikked entente of the bakbitere
  
   after bakbityng cometh gruchchyng or murmuracioun
  and somtyme it spryngeth of inpacience agayns god
  and somtyme agayns man
  
  500 agayn god it is whan a man gruccheth agayn the peyne of helle
  or agayns poverte
  or los of catel
  
  500a or agayn reyn or tempest
  or elles gruccheth that shrewes han prosperitee
  or elles for that goode men han adversitee
  
   and alle thise thynges sholde man suffre paciently
  for they comen by the rightful juggement and ordinaunce of god
  
   somtyme comth grucching of avarice
  
   as judas grucched agayns the magdaleyne whan she enoynted the heved of oure lord jhesu crist with hir precious oynement
  
   this manere murmure is swich as whan man gruccheth of goodnesse that hymself dooth
  or that oother folk doon of hir owene catel
  
   somtyme comth murmure of pride
  as whan simon the pharisee gruchched agayn the magdaleyne 
   whan she approched to jhesu crist and weep at his feet for hire synnes
  
   and somtyme grucchyng sourdeth of envye
  whan men discovereth a mannes harm that was pryvee or 
   bereth hym on hond thyng that is fals
  
   murmure eek is ofte amonges servauntz that grucchen whan hir sovereyns bidden hem doon leveful thynges
  
   and forasmuche as they dar nat openly withseye the comaundementz of hir sovereyns
  
   yet wol they seyn harm
  and grucche
  and murmure prively for verray despit
  
   whiche wordes men clepen the develes pater noster
  though so be that the devel ne hadde nevere pater noster
  
   but that lewed folk yeven it swich a name
  
   somtyme it comth of ire or prive hate that norisseth rancour in herte
  as afterward i shal declare
  
  510 thanne cometh eek bitternesse of herte
  thurgh which bitternesse every good dede of his neighebor semeth to hym bitter and unsavory
  
   thanne cometh discord that unbyndeth alle manere of freendshipe
  thanne comth scornynge of his neighebor
  al do he never so weel
  
   thanne comth accusynge
  as whan man seketh occasioun to anoyen his neighebor
  
   which that is lyk the craft of the devel
  that waiteth bothe nyght and day to accusen us alle
  
   thanne comth malignitee
  thurgh which a man anoyeth his neighebor prively
  if he may
  
   and if he noght may
  algate his wikked wil ne shal nat wante
  
   as for to brennen his hous pryvely
  or empoysone or sleen his beestes
  and semblable thynges
  
   now wol i speke of remedie agayns this foule synne of envye
  first is the love of god principal 
   and lovyng of his neighebor as hymself
  for soothly that oon ne may nat been withoute that oother
  
   and truste wel that in the name of thy neighebor thou shalt understonde the name of thy brother
  
   for certes alle we have o fader flesshly and o mooder    that is to seyn
  adam and eve    
   and eek o fader espiritueel
  and that is god of hevene
  
   thy neighebor artow holden for to love and wilne hym alle goodnesse
  and therfore seith god
  
   
 love thy neighebor as thyselve
     that is to seyn
  to salvacioun bothe of lyf and of soule
  
   and mooreover thou shalt love hym in word
  and in benigne amonestynge and chastisynge
  
   and conforten hym in his anoyes
  and preye for hym with al thyn herte
  
   and in dede thou shalt love hym in swich wise that thou shalt doon to hym in charitee 
   as thou woldest that it were doon to thyn owene persone
  
  520 and therfore thou ne shalt doon hym no damage in wikked word
  ne harm in his body
  
  520a ne in his catel
  ne in his soule
  by entissyng of wikked ensample
  
   thou shalt nat desiren his wyf ne none of his thynges
  understoond eek that in the name of neighebor is comprehended his enemy
  
   certes
  man shal loven his enemy
  by the comandement of god
  and soothly thy freend shaltow love in god
  
   i seye
  thyn enemy shaltow love for goddes sake
  by his commandement
  
   for if it were reson that man sholde haten his enemy
  
   for sothe god nolde nat receyven us to his love that been his enemys
  
   agayns three manere of wronges that his enemy dooth to hym
  he shal doon three thynges
  as thus
  
   agayns hate and rancour of herte
  he shal love hym in herte
  
   agayns chidyng and wikkede wordes
  he shal preye for his enemy
  agayns the wikked dede of his enemy
  he shal doon hym bountee
  
   for crist seith
  
 loveth youre enemys
  and preyeth for hem that speke yow harm
  and eek for hem that yow chacen and pursewen
  
   and dooth bountee to hem that yow haten
 
  loo
  thus comaundeth us oure lord jhesu crist to do to oure enemys
  
   for soothly
  nature dryveth us to loven oure freendes
  and parfey
  oure enemys han moore nede to love than oure freendes
  
   and they that moore nede have
  certes to hem shal men doon goodnesse
  
   and certes
  in thilke dede have we remembraunce of the love of jhesu crist that deyde for his enemys
  
   and in as muche as thilke love is the moore grevous to parfourne
  so muche is the moore gret the merite
  
   and therfore the lovynge of oure enemy hath confounded the venym of the devel
  
  530 for right as the devel is disconfited by humylitee
  right so is he wounded to the deeth by love of oure enemy
  
   certes
  thanne is love the medicine that casteth out the venym of envye fro mannes herte
  
   the speces of this paas shullen be moore largely declared in hir chapitres folwynge
  
   after envye wol i discryven the synne of ire
  for soothly
  whoso hath envye upon his neighebor
  
   anon he wole comunly fynde hym a matere of wratthe
  in word or in dede
  agayns hym to whom he hath envye
  
   and as wel comth ire of pride as of envye
  for soothly he that is proud or envyous is lightly wrooth
  
   this synne of ire
  after the discryvyng of seint augustyn
  is wikked wil to been avenged by word or by dede
  
   ire
  after the philosophre
  is the fervent blood of man yquyked in his herte
  
   thurgh which he wole harm to hym that he hateth
  
   for certes
  the herte of man
  by eschawfynge and moevynge of his blood
  wexeth 
   so trouble that he is out of alle juggement of resoun
  
   but ye shal understonde that ire is in two maneres
  that oon of hem is good
  and that oother is wikked
  
   the goode ire is by jalousie of goodnesse
  
   thurgh which a man is wrooth with wikkednesse and agayns wikkednesse
  and therfore seith a wys man that ire is bet than pley
  
  540 this ire is with debonairetee
  and it is wrooth withouten bitternesse
  nat wrooth agayns the man
  
  540a but wrooth with the mysdede of the man
  as seith the prophete david
  
 irascimini et nolite peccare
 
  
   now understondeth that wikked ire is in two maneres
  
   that is to seyn
  sodeyn ire or hastif ire
  withouten avisement and consentynge of resoun
  
   the menyng and the sens of this is that the resoun of a man ne consente nat to thilke sodeyn ire
  
   and thanne is it venial
  
   another ire is ful wikked
  that comth of felonie of herte avysed and cast biforn
  with wikked wil to do vengeance
  
   and therto his resoun consenteth
  and soothly this is deedly synne
  
   this ire is so displesant to god that it troubleth his hous and chaceth the hooly goost out of mannes soule
  
   and wasteth and destroyeth the liknesse of god    that is to seyn
  the vertu that is in mannes soule    
   and put in hym the liknesse of the devel
  and bynymeth the man fro god
  that is his rightful lord
  
   this ire is a ful greet plesaunce to the devel
  
   for it is the develes fourneys
  that is eschawfed with the fir of helle
  
   for certes
  right so as fir is moore mighty to destroyen erthely thynges than any oother element
  
   right so ire is myghty to destroyen alle spiritueel thynges
  
   looke how that fir of smale gleedes that been almost dede under asshen wollen quike agayn whan they been touched with brymstoon
  
   right so ire wol everemo quyken agayn whan it is touched by the pride that is covered in mannes herte
  
   for certes
  fir ne may nat comen out of no thyng
  but if it were first in the same thyng natureelly
  
   as fir is drawen out of flyntes with steel
  
  550 and right so as pride is ofte tyme matere of ire
  right so is rancour norice and kepere of ire
  
   ther is a maner tree
  as seith seint ysidre
  that whan men maken fir of thilke tree 
   and covere the coles of it with asshen
  soothly the fir of it wol lasten al a yeer or moore
  
   and right so fareth it of rancour
  whan it is ones conceyved in the hertes of som men
  
   certein
  it wol lasten peraventure from oon estre day unto another estre day
  and moore
  
   but certes
  thilke man is ful fer fro the mercy of god al thilke while
  
   in this forseyde develes fourneys ther forgen three shrewes
  pride
  that ay bloweth and encreesseth the fir by chidynge and wikked wordes
  
   thanne stant envye and holdeth the hoote iren upon the herte of man with a peire of longe toonges of long rancour
  
   and thanne stant the synne of contumelie
  or strif and cheeste
  and batereth and forgeth by vileyns reprevynges
  
   certes
  this cursed synne anoyeth bothe to the man hymself and eek to his neighebor
  
   for soothly
  almoost al the harm that any man dooth to his neighebor comth of wratthe
  
   for certes
  outrageous wratthe dooth al that evere the devel hym comaundeth
  for he ne spareth neither crist ne his sweete mooder
  
   and in his outrageous anger and ire    allas
  allas
     
   ful many oon at that tyme feeleth in his herte ful wikkedly
  bothe of crist and eek of alle his halwes
  
  560 is nat this a cursed vice
  yis
  certes
  allas
  it bynymeth from man his wit and his resoun
  
  560a and al his debonaire lif espiritueel that sholde kepen his soule
  
   certes
  it bynymeth eek goddes due lordshipe
  and that is mannes soule and the love of his neighebores
  
   it stryveth eek alday agayn trouthe
  it reveth hym the quiete of his herte and subverteth his soule
  
   of ire comen thise stynkynge engendrures
  first
  hate
  that is oold wratthe
  
   discord
  thurgh which a man forsaketh his olde freend that he hath loved ful longe
  
   and thanne cometh werre and every manere of wrong that man dooth to his neighebor
  in body or in catel
  
   of this cursed synne of ire cometh eek manslaughtre
  and understonde wel that homycide
  that is manslaughtre
  is in diverse wise
  
   som manere of homycide is spiritueel
  and som is bodily
  
   spiritueel manslaughtre is in sixe thynges
  first by hate
  as seith seint john
  
 he that hateth his brother is an homycide
 
  
   homycide is eek by bakbitynge
  of whiche bakbiteres seith salomon that 
 they han two swerdes with whiche they sleen hire neighebores
 
  
   for soothly
  as wikke is to bynyme his good name as his lyf
  
   homycide is eek in yevynge of wikked conseil by fraude
  as for to yeven conseil to areysen wrongful custumes and taillages
  
   of whiche seith salomon
  
 leon rorynge and bere hongry been like to the cruel lordshipes
  in withholdynge or abreggynge of the shepe 
    or the hyre 
  or of the wages of servauntz
  or elles in usure
  or in withdrawynge of the almesse of povre folk
  
   for which the wise man seith
  
 fedeth hym that almoost dyeth for honger
 
  for soothly
  but if thow feede hym
  thou sleest hym
  
   and alle thise been deedly synnes
  
  570 bodily manslaughtre is
  whan thow sleest him with thy tonge in oother manere
  
  570a as whan thou comandest to sleen a man or elles yevest hym conseil to sleen a man
  
   manslaughtre in dede is in foure maneres
  
   that oon is by lawe
  right as a justice dampneth hym that is coupable to the deeth
  
   but lat the justice be war that he do it rightfully
  and 
   that he do it nat for delit to spille blood but for kepynge of rightwisnesse
  
   another homycide is that is doon for necessitee
  as whan o man sleeth another in his defendaunt 
   and that he ne may noon ootherwise escape from his owene deeth
  
   but certeinly if he may escape withouten slaughtre of his adversarie
  and sleeth hym
  
   he dooth synne and he shal bere penance as for deedly synne
  
   eek if a man
  by caas or aventure
  shete an arwe
  
   or caste a stoon with which he sleeth a man
  he is homycide
  
   eek if a womman by necligence overlyeth hire child in hir slepyng
  it is homycide and deedly synne
  
   eek whan man destourbeth concepcioun of a child
  and maketh a womman outher bareyne 
   by drynkynge venenouse herbes thurgh which she may nat conceyve
  
   or sleeth a child by drynkes wilfully
  or elles putteth certeine material thynges in hire secree places to slee the child
  
   or elles dooth unkyndely synne
  by which man or womman shedeth hire nature in manere or in place 
   ther as a child may nat be conceived
  or elles if a woman have conceyved
  
   and hurt hirself and sleeth the child
  yet is it homycide
  
   what seye we eek of wommen that mordren hir children for drede of worldly shame
  certes
  an horrible homicide
  
   homycide is eek if a man approcheth to a womman by desir of lecherie
  thurgh which the child is perissed
  
   or elles smyteth a womman wityngly
  thurgh which she leseth hir child
  alle thise been homycides and horrible deedly synnes
  
  580 yet comen ther of ire manye mo synnes
  as wel in word as in thoght and in dede
  
  580a as he that arretteth upon god
  or blameth god of thyng of which he is hymself gilty
  
  580b or despiseth god and alle his halwes
  as doon thise cursede hasardours in diverse contrees
  
   this cursed synne doon they
  whan they feelen in hir herte ful wikkedly of god and of his halwes
  
   also whan they treten unreverently the sacrement of the auter
  thilke synne is so greet that unnethe may it been releessed
  
   but that the mercy of god passeth alle his werkes
  it is so greet
  and he so benigne
  
   thanne comth of ire attry angre
  whan a man is sharply amonested in his shrifte to forleten his synne
  
   thanne wole he be angry
  and answeren hokerly and angrily
  and deffenden or excusen his synne by unstedefastnesse of his flessh
  
   or elles he dide it for to holde compaignye with his felawes
  or elles
  he seith
  the feend enticed hym
  
   or elles he dide it for his youthe
  or elles his compleccioun is so corageous that he may nat forbere
  
   or elles it is his destinee
  as he seith
  unto a certein 
   age
  or elles
  he seith
  it cometh hym of gentillesse of his auncestres
  and semblable thynges
  
   alle thise manere of folk so wrappen hem in hir synnes that they ne wol nat delivere hemself
  
   for soothly
  no wight that excuseth hym wilfully of his synne 
   may nat been delivered of his synne til that he mekely biknoweth his synne
  
   after this
  thanne cometh sweryng
  that is expres agayn the comandement of god
  and this bifalleth ofte of anger and of ire
  
   god seith
  
 thow shalt nat take the name of thy lord god in veyn or in ydel
 
  
   also oure lord jhesu crist seith
  by the word of seint mathew
  
   
 ne wol ye nat swere in alle manere
  neither by hevene
  for it is goddes trone
  
   ne by erthe
  for it is the bench of his feet
  ne by jerusalem
  for it is the citee of a greet kyng
  
   ne by thyn heed
  for thou mayst nat make an heer whit ne blak
  
  590 but seyeth by youre word  ye
  ye
   and  nay
  nay 
  and what that is moore
  it is of yvel
     thus seith crist
  
   for cristes sake
  ne swereth nat so synfully in dismembrynge of crist by soule
  herte
  bones
  and body
  
   for certes
  it semeth that ye thynke that the cursede jewes ne dismembred nat ynough the preciouse persone of crist
  
   but ye dismembre hym moore
  
   and if so be that the lawe compelle yow to swere
  thanne rule yow after the lawe of god in youre swerying
  
   as seith jeremye
  quarto capitulo
  thou shalt kepe three condicions
  thou shalt swere 
 in trouthe
  in doom
  and in rightwisnesse
 
  
   this is to seyn
  thou shalt swere sooth
  for every lesynge is agayns crist
  
   for crist is verray trouthe
  and thynk wel this
  that 
 every greet swerere
  nat compelled lawefully to 
   swere
  the wounde shal nat departe from his hous
  whil he useth swich unleveful swerying
  
   thou shalt sweren eek in doom
  whan thou art constreyned by thy domesman to witnessen the trouthe
  
   eek thow shalt nat swere for envye
  ne for favour
  ne for meede
  but for rightwisnesse
  for declaracioun of it
  
   to the worshipe of god and helpyng of thyne evene cristene
  
   and therfore every man that taketh goddes name in ydel
  or falsly swereth with his mouth
  
   or elles taketh on hym the name of crist
  to be called a cristen man 
   and lyveth agayns cristes lyvynge and his techynge
  alle they taken goddes name in ydel
  
   looke eek what seint peter seith
  actuum quarto
  non est aliud nomen sub celo
  etc
 
  
 ther nys noon oother name
 
  seith seint peter
  
   
 under hevene yeven to men
  in which they mowe be saved
 
  that is to seyn
  but the name of jhesu crist
  
   take kep eek how precious is the name of crist
  as seith seint paul
  ad philipenses secundo
  in nomine jhesu
  etc
 
  
   
 that in the name of jhesu every knee of hevenely creatures
  or erthely
  or of helle sholde 
   bowe
 
  for it is so heigh and so worshipful that the cursede feend in helle sholde tremblen to heeren it ynempned
  
   thanne semeth it that men that sweren so horribly by his blessed name
  
   that they despise it moore booldely than dide the cursede jewes or elles the devel
  that trembleth whan he heereth his name
  
  600 now certes
  sith that sweryng
  but if it be lawefully doon
  is so heighly deffended
  muche worse is forsweryng falsly
  and yet nedelees
  
   what seye we eek of hem that deliten hem in sweryng
  
   and holden it a gentrie or a manly dede to swere grete othes
  
   and what of hem that of verray usage ne cesse nat to swere grete othes
  al be the cause nat worth a straw
  
   certes
  this is horrible synne
  
   swerynge sodeynly withoute avysement is eek a synne
  
   but lat us go now to thilke horrible sweryng of adjuracioun and conjuracioun
  
   as doon thise false enchauntours or nigromanciens in bacyns ful of water
  
   or in a bright swerd
  in a cercle
  or in a fir
  or in a shulder boon of a sheep
  
   i kan nat seye but that they doon cursedly and dampnably agayns crist and al the feith of hooly chirche
  
   what seye we of hem that bileeven on divynailes
  as by flight or by noyse of briddes
  or of beestes
  
   or by sort
  by nigromancie
  by dremes
  by chirkynge of dores or crakkynge of houses
  by gnawynge of rattes
  and swich manere wrecchednesse
  
   certes
  al this thyng is deffended by god and by hooly chirche
  
   for which they been acursed
  til they come to amendement
  that on swich filthe setten hire bileeve
  
   charmes for woundes or maladie of men or of beestes
  if they taken any effect
  
   it may be peraventure that god suffreth it
  for folk sholden yeve the moore feith and reverence to his name
  
   now wol i speken of lesynges
  which generally is fals signyficaunce of word
  in entente to deceyven his evene cristene
  
   som lesynge is of which ther comth noon avantage to no wight
  
   and som lesynge turneth to the ese and profit of o man
  and to disese and damage of another man
  
  610 another lesynge is for to saven his lyf or his catel
  another 
  610a lesynge comth of delit for to lye
  in which delit they wol forge a long tale 
  610b and peynten it with alle circumstaunces
  where al the ground of the tale is fals
  
   som lesynge comth for he wole sustene his word
  and som lesynge comth of reccheleesnesse withouten avisement
  and semblable thynges
  
   lat us now touche the vice of flaterynge
  which ne comth nat gladly but for drede or for coveitise
  
   flaterye is generally wrongful preisynge
  flatereres been the develes norices
  that norissen his children with milk of losengerie
  
   for sothe
  salomon seith that 
 flaterie is wors than detraccioun
 
  for somtyme detraccion maketh an hauteyn man be the moore humble
  
   for he dredeth detraccion
  but certes flaterye
  that maketh a man to enhauncen his herte and his contenaunce
  
   flatereres been the develes enchauntours
  for they make a man to wene of hymself be lyk that he nys nat lyk
  
   they been lyk to judas that bitraysen a man to sellen hym to his enemy
  that is to the devel
  
   flatereres been the develes chapelleyns
  that syngen evere placebo
  
   i rekene flaterie in the vices of ire
  
   for ofte tyme if o man be wrooth with another
  thanne wole he flatere som wight to sustene hym in his querele
  
   speke we now of swich cursynge as comth of irous herte
  malisoun generally may be seyd every maner power of harm
  
   swich cursynge bireveth man fro the regne of god
  as seith seint paul
  
  620 and ofte tyme swich cursynge wrongfully retorneth agayn to hym that curseth
  as a bryd that retorneth agayn to his owene nest
  
   and over alle thyng men oghten eschewe to cursen hire children
  and yeven to the devel hire engendrure
  
   as ferforth as in hem is
  certes
  it is greet peril and greet synne
  
   lat us thanne speken of chidynge and reproche
  whiche been ful grete woundes in mannes herte
  
   for they unsowen the semes of freendshipe in mannes herte
  
   for certes
  unnethes may a man pleynly been accorded with hym that hath hym openly revyled and repreved and disclaundred
  
   this is a ful grisly synne
  as crist seith in the gospel
  
   and taak kep now
  that he that repreveth his neighebor
  outher he repreveth hym by som harm of peyne 
   that he hath on his body
  as 
 mesel
 
  
 croked harlot
 
  or by som synne that he dooth
  
   now if he repreve hym by harm of peyne
  thanne turneth the repreve to jhesu crist
  
   for peyne is sent by the rightwys sonde of god
  and by his suffrance
  be it meselrie
  or maheym
  or maladie
  
   and if he repreve hym uncharitably of synne
  as 
 thou holour
 
  
 thou dronkelewe harlot
 
  and so forth
  
   thanne aperteneth that to the rejoysynge of the devel
  that evere hath joye that men doon synne
  
   and certes
  chidynge may nat come but out of a vileyns herte
  
   for after the habundance of the herte speketh the mouth ful ofte
  
   and ye shul understonde that looke
  by any wey
  
   whan any man shal chastise another
  that he be war from chidynge or reprevynge
  
   for trewely
  but he be war
  he may ful lightly quyken the fir of angre and of wratthe
  
   which that he sholde quenche
  and peraventure sleeth hym which that he myghte chastise with benignitee
  
   for as seith salomon
  
 the amyable tonge is the tree of lyf
     that is to seyn
  of lyf espiritueel    
   and soothly
  a deslavee tonge sleeth the spirites of hym that repreveth and eek of hym that is repreved
  
  630 loo
  what seith seint augustyn
  
 ther is nothyng so lyk the develes child as he that ofte chideth
 
  
  630a seint paul seith eek
  
 the servant of god bihoveth nat to chide
 
  
   and how that chidynge be a vileyns thyng bitwixe alle manere folk
  
   yet is it certes moost uncovenable bitwixe a man and his wyf
  
   for there is nevere reste
  and therfore seith salomon
  
 an 
   hous that is uncovered and droppynge and a chidynge wyf been lyke
 
  
   a man that is in a droppynge hous in manye places
  
   though he eschewe the droppynge in o place
  it droppeth on hym in another place
  
   so fareth it by a chydynge wyf
  but she chide hym in o place
  she wol chide hym in another
  
   and therfore
  
 bettre is a morsel of breed with joye than an hous ful of delices with chidynge
 
  seith salomon
  
   seint paul seith
  
 o ye wommen
  be ye subgetes to youre housbondes as bihoveth in god
  
   and ye men loveth youre wyves
 
  ad colossenses tertio
  
   afterward speke we of scornynge
  which is a wikked synne
  and namely whan he scorneth a man for his goode werkes
  
   for certes
  swiche scorneres faren lyk the foule 
   tode
  that may nat endure to smelle the soote savour of the vyne whanne it florissheth
  
   thise scorneres been partyng felawes with the devel
  for they han joye whan the devel wynneth and sorwe whan he leseth
  
   they been adversaries of jhesu crist
  for they haten that he loveth    that is to seyn
  salvacioun of soule
  
   speke we now of wikked conseil
  for he that wikked conseil yeveth is a traytour
  
   for he deceyveth hym that trusteth in hym
  ut achitofel ad absolonem
  but nathelees
  yet is his wikked conseil first agayn hymself
  
  640 for
  as seith the wise man
  
 every fals lyvynge hath this propertee in hymself
  that 
  640a he that wole anoye another man
  he anoyeth first hymself
 
  
   and men shul understonde that man shal nat taken his conseil of fals folk
  ne of angry folk
  or grevous folk
  
   ne of folk that loven specially to muchel hir owene profit
  ne to muche worldly folk
  namely in conseilynge of soules
  
   now comth the synne of hem that sowen and maken discord amonges folk
  which is a synne that crist hateth outrely
  
   and no wonder is
  for he deyde for to make concord
  
   and moore shame do they to crist than dide they that hym crucifiede
  
   for god loveth bettre that freendshipe be amonges folk
  than he dide his owene body
  
   the which that he yaf for unitee
  therfore been they likned to the devel
  that evere is aboute to maken discord
  
   now comth the synne of double tonge
  swiche as speken faire byforn folk and wikkedly bihynde
  or elles they maken semblant 
   as though they speeke of good entencioun
  or elles in game and pley
  and yet they speke of wikked entente
  
   now comth biwreying of conseil
  thurgh which a man is defamed
  certes
  unnethe may he restoore the damage
  
   now comth manace
  that is an open folye
  for he that ofte manaceth
  he threteth moore than he may parfourne ful ofte tyme
  
   now cometh ydel wordes
  that is withouten profit of hym that speketh tho wordes
  
   and eek of hym that herkneth tho wordes
  or elles ydel wordes been tho that been nedelees or withouten entente of natureel profit
  
   and al be it that ydel wordes been somtyme venial synne
  
   yet sholde men douten hem
  for we shul yeve rekenynge of hem bifore god
  
   now comth janglynge
  that may nat been withoute synne
  and
  as seith salomon
  
 it is a sygne of apert folye
 
  
  650 and therfore a philosophre seyde
  whan men axed hym how that men sholde plese the peple
  
  650a and he answerde
  
 do manye goode werkes
  and spek fewe jangles
 
  
   after this comth the synne of japeres
  that been the develes apes
  
   for they maken folk to laughe at hire japerie as folk doon at the gawdes of an ape
  
   swiche japeres deffendeth seint paul
  
   looke how that vertuouse wordes and hooly conforten hem that travaillen in the service of crist
  
   right so conforten the vileyns wordes and knakkes of japeris hem that travaillen in the service of the devel
  
   thise been the synnes that comen of the tonge
  that comen of ire and of othere synnes mo
  
   the remedie agayns ire is a vertu that men clepen mansuetude
  that is debonairetee
  
   and eek another vertu
  that men callen pacience or suffrance
  
   debonairetee withdraweth and refreyneth the stirynges and the moevynges of mannes corage in his herte
  
   in swich manere that they ne skippe nat out by angre ne by ire
  
   suffrance suffreth swetely alle the anoyaunces and the wronges that men doon to man outward
  
   seint jerome seith thus of debonairetee
  that 
 it dooth noon harm to no wight ne seith
  
   ne for noon harm that men doon or seyn
  he ne eschawfeth nat agayns his resoun
 
  
   this vertu somtyme comth of nature
  for
  as seith the philosophre
  
   
 a man is a quyk thyng
  by nature debonaire and tretable to goodnesse
  
   but whan debonairetee is enformed of grace
  thanne is it the moore worth
 
  
   pacience
  that is another remedie agayns ire
  is a vertu that suffreth swetely every mannes goodnesse
  
   and is nat wrooth for noon harm that is doon to hym
  
  660 the philosophre seith that pacience is thilke vertu that suffreth debonairely alle the outrages of adversitee and every wikked word
  
   this vertu maketh a man lyk to god
  and maketh hym goddes owene deere child
  as seith crist
  
   this vertu disconfiteth thyn enemy
  and therfore seith the wise man
  
 if thow wolt venquysse thyn enemy
  lerne to suffre
 
  
   and thou shalt understonde that man suffreth foure manere of grevances in outward thynges
  
   agayns the whiche foure he moot have foure manere of paciences
  
   the firste grevance is of wikkede wordes
  thilke suffrede jhesu crist withouten grucchyng
  ful paciently
  
   whan the jewes despised and repreved hym ful ofte
  
   suffre thou therfore paciently
  for the wise man seith
  
 if thou stryve with a fool
  
   though the fool be wrooth or though he laughe
  algate thou shalt have no reste
 
  
   that oother grevance outward is to have damage of thy catel
  theragayns suffred crist ful paciently
  whan 
   he was despoyled of al that he hadde in this lyf
  and that nas but his clothes
  
   the thridde grevance is a man to have harm in his body
  that suffred crist ful paciently in al his passioun
  
   the fourthe grevance is in outrageous labour in werkes
  
   wherfore i seye that folk that maken hir servantz to travaillen to grevously or out of tyme
  as on haly dayes
  
   soothly they do greet synne
  
   heer agayns suffred crist ful paciently and taughte us pacience
  whan he baar upon his blissed shulder 
   the croys upon which he sholde suffren despitous deeth
  
   heere may men lerne to be pacient
  for certes noght oonly cristen men been pacient for love of jhesu crist 
   and for gerdoun of the blisful lyf that is perdurable
  but 
   certes
  the olde payens that nevere were cristene commendeden and useden the vertu of pacience
  
  670 a philosophre upon a tyme
  that wolde have beten his disciple for his grete trespas
  
  670a for which he was greetly amoeved
  and broghte a yerde to scoure with the child
  
   and whan this child saugh the yerde
  he seyde to his maister
  
   
 what thenke ye do
 
  
 i wol bete thee
 
  quod the maister
  
 for thy correccioun
 
  
   
 for sothe
 
  quod the child
  
 ye oghten first correcte youreself
  
   that han lost al youre pacience for the gilt of a child
 
  
   
 for sothe
 
  quod the maister al wepynge
  
 thow seyst sooth
  have thow the yerde
  my deere sone
  and correcte me for myn inpacience
 
  
   of pacience comth obedience
  thurgh which a man is obedient to crist and to alle hem 
   to whiche he oghte to been obedient in crist
  
   and understond wel that obedience is parfit 
   whan that a man dooth gladly and hastily
  with good herte entierly
  al that he sholde do
  
   obedience generally is to parfourne the doctrine of god and of his sovereyns
  to whiche hym oghte to ben obeisaunt in alle rightwisnesse
  
   after the synne of envye and of ire
  now wol i speken of the synne of accidie
  
   for envye blyndeth the herte of a man
  and ire troubleth a man
  and accidie maketh hym hevy
  thoghtful
  and wraw
  
   envye and ire maken bitternesse in herte
  which bitternesse is mooder of accidie
  and bynymeth hym the love of alle goodnesse
  
   thanne is accidie the angwissh of troubled herte
  and seint augustyn seith
  
 it is anoy of goodnesse and joye of harm
 
  
   certes
  this is a dampnable synne
  for it dooth wrong to jhesu crist
  
   in as muche as it bynymeth the service that men oghte doon to crist with alle diligence
  as seith salomon
  
  680 but accidie dooth no swich diligence
  he dooth alle thyng with anoy
  and with wrawnesse
  slaknesse
  and excusacioun
  and with ydelnesse
  and unlust
  
  680a for which the book seith
  
 acursed be he that dooth the service of god necligently
 
  
   thanne is accidie enemy to everich estaat of man
  for certes the estaat of man is in three maneres
  
   outher it is th  estaat of innocence
  as was th  estaat of adam biforn that he fil into synne
  
   in which estaat he was holden to wirche as in heriynge and adowrynge of god
  
   another estaat is the estaat of synful men
  in which estaat men been holden to laboure in preiynge to god 
   for amendement of hire synnes
  and that he wole graunte hem to arysen out of hir synnes
  
   another estaat is th  estaat of grace
  in which estaat he is holden to werkes of penitence
  
   and certes
  to alle thise thynges is accidie enemy and contrarie
  for he loveth no bisynesse at al
  
   now certes this foule synne accidie is eek a ful greet enemy to the liflode of the body
  
   for it ne hath no purveaunce agayn temporeel necessitee
  for it forsleweth and forsluggeth and destroyeth alle goodes temporeles by reccheleesnesse
  
   the fourthe thyng is that accidie is lyk hem that been in the peyne of helle
  by cause of hir slouthe 
   and of hire hevynesse
  for they that been dampned been so bounde that they ne may neither wel do ne wel thynke
  
   of accidie comth first that a man is anoyed and encombred for to doon any goodnesse
  
   and maketh that god hath abhomynacion of swich accidie
  as seith seint john
  
   now comth slouthe
  that wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne no penaunce
  for soothly
  slouthe is so tendre and so delicaat
  
   as seith salomon
  that he wol nat suffre noon hardnesse ne penaunce
  and therfore he shendeth al that he dooth
  
   agayns this roten herted synne of accidie and slouthe sholde men exercise hemself to doon goode werkes
  and manly 
   and vertuously cacchen corage wel to doon
  thynkynge that oure lord jhesu crist quiteth every good dede
  be it never so lite
  
  690 usage of labour is a greet thyng
  for it maketh
  as seith seint bernard
  the laborer to have stronge armes and harde synwes
  
  690a and slouthe maketh hem feble and tendre
  
   thanne comth drede to bigynne to werke anye goode werkes
  for certes
  he that is enclyned to synne
  
   hym thynketh it is so greet an emprise for to undertake to doon werkes of goodnesse
  
   and casteth in his herte that the circumstaunces of goodnesse been so grevouse 
   and so chargeaunt for to suffre
  that he dar nat undertake to do werkes of goodnesse
  as seith seint gregorie
  
   now comth wanhope
  that is despeir of the mercy of god
  that comth somtyme of to muche outrageous sorwe
  
   and somtyme of to muche drede
  ymaginynge that he hath doon so muche synne that it wol nat availlen hym
  
   though he wolde repenten hym and forsake synne
  
   thurgh which despeir or drede he abaundoneth al his herte to every maner synne
  as seith seint augustin
  
   which dampnable synne
  if that it continue unto his ende
  it is cleped synnyng in the hooly goost
  
   this horrible synne is so perilous that he that is despeired
  
   ther nys no felonye ne no synne that he douteth for to do
  as shewed wel by judas
  
   certes
  aboven alle synnes thanne is this synne moost displesant to crist
  and moost adversarie
  
   soothly
  he that despeireth hym is lyk the coward champioun recreant
  that seith 
 creant
  withoute nede
  
   allas
  allas
  nedeles is he recreant and nedelees despeired
  
   certes
  the mercy of god is evere redy to the penitent
  and is aboven alle his werkes
  
  700 allas
  kan a man nat bithynke hym on the gospel of seint luc
  15
  
  700a where as crist seith that 
 as wel shal ther be joye in hevene upon a synful man that dooth penitence
  
  700b as upon nynty and nyne rightful men that neden no penitence
 
  
   looke forther
  in the same gospel
  the joye and the feeste of the goode man that hadde lost his sone
  
   whan his sone with repentaunce was retourned to his fader
  
   kan they nat remembren hem eek that
  as seith seint luc
  23
  how that the theef that was hanged bisyde jhesu crist seyde
  
   
 lord
  remembre of me
  whan thow comest into thy regn
 
 
  
   
 for sothe
 
  seyde crist
  
 i seye to thee
  to day shaltow been with me in paradys
 
  
   certes
  ther is noon so horrible synne of man 
   that it ne may in his lyf be destroyed by penitence
  thurgh vertu of the passion and of the deeth of crist
  
   allas
  what nedeth man thanne to been despeired
  sith that his mercy so redy is and large
  axe and have
  
   thanne cometh sompnolence
  that is sloggy slombrynge
  which maketh a man be hevy and dul in body and in soule
  
   and this synne comth of slouthe
  
   and certes
  the tyme that
  by wey of resoun
  men sholde nat slepe
  that is by the morwe
  
   but if ther were cause resonable
  
   for soothly
  the morwe tyde is moost covenable a man to seye his preyeres
  and for to thynken on god
  
   and for to honoure god
  and to yeven almesse to the povre that first cometh in the name of crist
  
   lo
  what seith salomon
  
 whoso wolde by the morwe awaken and seke me
  he shal fynde
 
  
  710 thanne cometh necligence
  or reccheleesnesse
  that rekketh of no thyng
  
  710a and how that ignoraunce be mooder of alle harm
  certes
  necligence is the norice
  
   necligence ne dooth no fors
  whan he shal doon a thyng
  wheither he do it weel or baddely
  
   of the remedie of thise two synnes
  as seith the wise man
  
   that 
 he that dredeth god
  he spareth nat to doon that him oghte doon
 
  
   and he that loveth god
  he wol doon diligence to plese god by his werkes 
   and abaundone hymself
  with al his myght
  wel for to doon
  
   thanne comth ydelnesse
  that is the yate of alle harmes
  an ydel man is lyk to a place that hath no walles
  
   the develes may entre on every syde
  or sheten at hym at discovert
  by temptacion on every syde
  
   this ydelnesse is the thurrok of alle wikked and vileyns thoghtes
  and of alle jangles
  trufles
  and of alle ordure
  
   certes
  the hevene is yeven to hem that wol labouren
  and nat to ydel folk
  eek david seith that 
   
 they ne been nat in the labour of men
  ne they shul nat been whipped with men
  
      that is to seyn
  in purgatorie
  
   certes
  thanne semeth it they shul be tormented with the devel in helle
  but if they doon penitence
  
   thanne comth the synne that men clepen tarditas
  as whan a man is to laterede or tariynge er he wole turne to god
  
   and certes that is a greet folie
  he is lyk to hym that falleth in the dych and wol nat arise
  
   and this vice comth of a fals hope
  that he thynketh that he shal lyve longe
  but that hope faileth ful ofte
  
  720 thanne comth lachesse
  that is he that whan he biginneth any good werk 
  720a anon he shal forleten it and stynten
  as doon they that han any wight to governe 
  720b and ne taken of hym namoore kep anon as they fynden any contrarie or any anoy
  
   thise been the newe sheepherdes that leten hir sheep wityngly go renne 
   to the wolf that is in the breres
  or do no fors of hir owene governaunce
  
   of this comth poverte and destruccioun
  bothe of spiritueel and temporeel thynges
  
   thanne comth a manere cooldnesse
  that freseth al the herte of a man
  
   thanne comth undevocioun
  thurgh which a man is so blent
  as seith seint bernard
  
   and hath swich langour in soule that he may neither rede ne singe in hooly chirche
  ne heere ne thynke of no devocioun
  
   ne travaille with his handes in no good werk
  that it nys hym unsavory and al apalled
  
   thanne wexeth he slough and slombry
  and soone wol be wrooth
  and soone is enclyned to hate and to envye
  
   thanne comth the synne of worldly sorwe
  swich as is cleped tristicia
  that sleeth man
  as seith seint paul
  
   for certes
  swich sorwe werketh to the deeth of the soule and of the body also
  
   for therof comth that a man is anoyed of his owene lif
  
   wherfore swich sorwe shorteth ful ofte the lif of man
  er that his tyme be come by wey of kynde
  
   agayns this horrible synne of accidie
  and the branches of the same
  ther is a vertu that is called fortitudo or strengthe
  
   that is an affeccioun thurgh which a man despiseth anoyouse thinges
  
   this vertu is so myghty and so vigerous that it dar withstonde myghtily and wisely kepen hymself fro perils that been wikked
  
   and wrastle agayn the assautes of the devel
  
  730 for it enhaunceth and enforceth the soule
  right as accidie abateth it and maketh it fieble
  
  730a for this fortitudo may endure by long suffraunce the travailles that been covenable
  
   this vertu hath manye speces
  and the firste is cleped magnanimitee
  that is to seyn
  greet corage
  
   for certes
  ther bihoveth greet corage agains accidie
  
   lest that it ne swolwe the soule by the synne of sorwe
  or destroye it by wanhope
  
   this vertu maketh folk to undertake harde thynges and grevouse thynges
  by hir owene wil
  wisely and resonably
  
   and for as muchel as the devel fighteth agayns a man moore by queyntise and by sleighte than by strengthe
  
   therfore men shal withstonden hym by wit and by resoun and by discrecioun
  
   thanne arn ther the vertues of feith and hope in god and in his seintes 
   to acheve and acomplice the goode werkes in the whiche he purposeth fermely to continue
  
   thanne comth seuretee or sikernesse
  and that is 
   whan a man ne douteth no travaille in tyme comynge of the goode werkes that a man hath bigonne
  
   thanne comth magnificence
  that is to seyn
  whan a man dooth and parfourneth grete werkes of goodnesse
  and that is the ende 
   why that men sholde do goode werkes
  for in the acomplissynge of grete goode werkes lith the grete gerdoun
  
   thanne is ther constaunce
  that is stablenesse of corage
  and this sholde been in herte by stedefast feith
  
   and in mouth
  and in berynge
  and in chiere
  and in dede
  
   eke ther been mo speciale remedies against accidie in diverse werkes
  and 
   in consideracioun of the peynes of helle and of the joyes of hevene
  
   and in the trust of the grace of the holy goost
  that wole yeve hym myght to parfourne his goode entente
  
   after accidie wol i speke of avarice and of coveitise
  of which synne seith 
   seint paul that 
 the roote of alle harmes is coveitise
 
  ad thimotheum sexto
  
  740 for soothly
  whan the herte of a man is confounded in itself and troubled
  and that 
  740a the soule hath lost the confort of god
  thanne seketh he an ydel solas of worldly thynges
  
   avarice
  after the descripcioun of seint augustyn
  is a likerousnesse in herte to have erthely thynges
  
   som oother folk seyn that avarice is for to purchacen manye erthely thynges and no thyng yeve to hem that han nede
  
   and understoond that avarice ne stant nat oonly in lond ne catel
  
   but somtyme in science and in glorie
  and in every manere of outrageous thyng is avarice and coveitise
  
   and the difference bitwixe avarice and coveitise is this
  coveitise is for to coveite swiche thynges as thou hast nat
  
   and avarice is for to withholde and kepe swiche thynges as thou hast
  withoute rightful nede
  
   soothly
  this avarice is a synne that is ful dampnable
  for al hooly writ curseth it and speketh agayns that vice
  
   for it dooth wrong to jhesu crist
  
   for it bireveth hym the love that men to hym owen
  and turneth it bakward agayns alle resoun
  
   and maketh that the avaricious man hath moore hope in his catel than in jhesu crist
  
   and dooth moore observance in kepynge of his tresor than he dooth to the service of jhesu crist
  
   and therfore seith seint paul ad ephesios quinto
  that an avaricious man is the thraldom of ydolatrie
  
   what difference is bitwixe an ydolastre and an avaricious man
  but that an ydolastre
  per aventure
  ne hath but o mawmet or two
  
   and the avaricious man hath manye
  for certes
  every floryn in his cofre is his mawmet
  
  750 and certes
  the synne of mawmettrie is the firste thyng 
  750a that god deffended in the ten comaundementz
  as bereth witnesse in exodi capitulo vicesimo
  
   
 thou shalt have no false goddes bifore me
  ne thou shalt make to thee no grave thyng
 
  
   thus is an avaricious man
  that loveth his tresor biforn god
  an ydolastre
  
   thurgh this cursed synne of avarice
  of coveitise comen thise harde lordshipes
  
   thurgh whiche men been distreyned by taylages
  custumes
  and cariages
  moore than hire duetee or resoun is
  
   and eek taken they of hire bonde men amercimentz
  whiche myghten moore resonably ben cleped extorcions than amercimentz
  
   of whiche amercimentz and raunsonynge of boonde men somme lordes stywardes seyn that it is rightful
  
   for as muche as a cherl hath no temporeel thyng that it ne is his lordes
  as they seyn
  
   but certes
  thise lord shipes doon wrong 
   that bireven hire bonde folk thynges that they nevere yave hem
  augustinus
  de civitate libro nono
  
   
 sooth is that the condicioun of thraldom and the firste cause of thraldom is for synne
  genesis nono
  
   thus may ye seen that the gilt disserveth thraldom
  but nat nature
 
  
   wherfore thise lordes ne sholde nat muche glorifien hem in hir lordshipes
  
   sith that by natureel condicion they been nat lordes over thralles
  but that thraldom comth first by the desert of synne
  
   and forther over
  ther as the lawe seith that temporeel goodes of boonde folk been the goodes of hir lordshipes
  ye
  
   that is for to understonde
  the goodes of the emperour
  to deffenden hem in hir right
  
   but nat for to robben hem ne reven hem
  
   and therfore seith seneca
  
 thy prudence sholde lyve benignely with thy thralles
 
  
  760 thilke that thou clepest thy thralles been goddes peple
  for humble folk been cristes freendes
  they been contubernyal with the lord
  
   thynk eek that of swich seed as cherles spryngen
  of swich seed spryngen lordes
  
   as wel may the cherl be saved as the lord
  
   the same deeth that taketh the cherl
  swich deeth taketh the lord
  
   wherfore i rede
  do right so with thy cherl
  as thou woldest that thy lord dide with thee
  
   if thou were in his plit
  
   every synful man is a cherl to synne
  i rede thee
  certes
  that thou
  lord
  
   werke in swich wise with thy cherles that they rather love thee than drede
  
   i woot wel ther is degree above degree
  as reson is
  
   and skile is that men do hir devoir ther as it is due
  
   but certes
  extorcions and despit of youre underlynges is dampnable
  
   and forther over
  understoond wel that thise conquerours or tirauntz maken ful ofte thralles 
   of hem that been born of as roial blood as been they that hem conqueren
  
   this name of thraldom was nevere erst kowth til 
   that noe seyde that his sone canaan sholde be thral to his bretheren for his synne
  
   what seye we thanne of hem that pilen and doon extorcions to hooly chirche
  
   certes
  the swerd that men yeven first to a knyght
  whan he is newe dubbed
  signifieth that he sholde deffenden hooly chirche
  
   and nat robben it ne pilen it
  and whoso dooth is traitour to crist
  
   and
  as seith seint augustyn
  
 they been the develes wolves that stranglen the sheep of jhesu crist
 
  and doon worse than wolves
  
   for soothly
  whan the wolf hath ful his wombe
  he stynteth to strangle sheep
  
   but soothly
  the pilours and destroyours of the godes of hooly chirche ne do nat so
  for they ne stynte nevere to pile
  
  770 now as i have seyd
  sith so is that synne was first cause of thraldom
  thanne is it thus
  
  770a that thilke tyme that al this world was in synne
  thanne was al this world in thraldom and subjeccioun
  
   but certes
  sith the time of grace cam
  god ordeyned that som folk sholde be moore heigh in estaat and in degree
  
   and som folk moore lough
  and that everich sholde be served in his estaat and in his degree
  
   and therfore in somme contrees
  ther they byen thralles
  whan they han turned hem to the feith
  
   they maken hire thralles free out of thraldom
  and therfore
  
   certes
  the lord oweth to his man that the man oweth to his lord
  
   the pope calleth hymself servant of the servantz of god
  but 
   for as muche as the estaat of hooly chirche ne myghte nat han be
  ne the commune profit myghte nat han be kept
  
   ne pees and rest in erthe
  but if god hadde ordeyned that som men hadde hyer degree and som men lower
  
   therfore was sovereyntee ordeyned
  to kepe and mayntene and deffenden hire underlynges or hire subgetz in resoun
  
   as ferforth as it lith in hire power
  and nat to destroyen hem ne confounde
  
   wherfore i seye that thilke lordes that been lyk wolves
  
   that devouren the possessiouns or the catel of povre folk wrongfully
  withouten mercy or mesure
  
   they shul receyven by the same mesure that they han mesured to povre folk the 
   mercy of jhesu crist
  but if it be amended
  
   now comth deceite bitwixe marchaunt and marchant
  and thow shalt understonde that marchandise is in manye maneres
  
   that oon is bodily
  and that oother is goostly
  that oon is honest and leveful
  and that oother is deshonest and unleveful
  
   of thilke bodily marchandise that is leveful and honest is this
  
   that
  there as god hath ordeyned that a regne or a contree is suffisaunt to hymself
  
   thanne is it honest and leveful that of habundaunce of this contree
  that men helpe another contree that is moore nedy
  
   and therfore ther moote been marchantz to bryngen fro that o contree to that oother hire marchandises
  
  780 that oother marchandise
  that men haunten with fraude and trecherie and deceite
  with lesynges and false othes
  is cursed and dampnable
  
   espiritueel marchandise is proprely symonye
  that is ententif desir to byen thyng espiritueel
  
   that is
  thyng that aperteneth to the seintuarie of god and to cure of the soule
  
   this desir
  if so be that a man do his diligence to parfournen it
  
   al be it that his desir ne take noon effect
  yet is it to hym a deedly synne
  
   and if he be ordred
  he is irreguleer
  
   certes symonye is cleped of simon magus
  that wolde han boght for temporeel catel 
   the yifte that god hadde yeven by the hooly goost to seint peter and to the apostles
  
   and therfore understoond that bothe he that selleth and he that beyeth thynges espirituels been cleped symonyals
  
   be it by catel
  be it by procurynge
  or by flesshly preyere of his freendes
  flesshly freendes or espiritueel freendes
  
   flesshly in two maneres
  as by kynrede
  or othere freendes
  soothly
  if they praye for hym that is nat worthy and able
  
   it is symonye
  if he take the benefice
  and if he be worthy and able
  ther nys noon
  
   that oother manere is whan men or wommen preyen for folk to avauncen hem
  
   oonly for wikked flesshly affeccioun that they han unto the persone
  and that is foul symonye
  
   but certes
  in service
  for which men yeven thynges espirituels unto hir servantz
  it moot been understonde that 
   the service moot been honest and elles nat
  and eek that it be withouten bargaynynge
  and that the persone be able
  
   for
  as seith seint damasie
  
 alle the synnes of the world
  at regard of this synne
  arn as thyng of noght
 
  
   for it is the gretteste synne that may be
  after the synne of lucifer and antecrist
  
   for by this synne god forleseth the chirche and the soule that he boghte with his precious blood
  
   by hem that yeven chirches to hem that been nat digne
  
  790 for they putten in theves that stelen the soules of jhesu crist and destroyen his patrimoyne
  
   by swiche undigne preestes and curates han lewed men the lasse reverence of the sacramentz of hooly chirche
  
   and swiche yeveres of chirches putten out the children of crist and putten into the chirche the develes owene sone
  
   they sellen the soules that lambes sholde kepen to the wolf that strangleth hem
  
   and therfore shul they nevere han part of the pasture of lambes
  that is the blisse of hevene
  
   now comth hasardrie with his apurtenaunces
  as tables and rafles
  of which comth deceite
  false othes
  chidynges
  and alle ravynes
  
   blasphemynge and reneiynge of god
  and hate of his neighebores
  wast of goodes
  mysspendynge of tyme
  and somtyme manslaughtre
  
   certes
  hasardours ne mowe nat been withouten greet synne whiles they haunte that craft
  
   of avarice comen eek lesynges
  thefte
  fals witnesse
  and false othes
  
   and ye shul understonde that thise been grete synnes and expres agayn the comaundementz of god
  as i have seyd
  
   fals witnesse is in word and eek in dede
  in word
  as for to bireve thy neighebores goode name by thy fals witnessyng
  
   or bireven hym his catel or his heritage by thy fals witnessyng
  whan thou for ire
  or for meede
  
   or for envye
  berest fals witnesse
  or accusest hym or excusest hym by thy fals witnesse
  or elles excusest thyself falsly
  
   ware yow
  questemongeres and notaries
  certes
  for fals witnessyng was susanna in ful gret sorwe and peyne
  and many another mo
  
   the synne of thefte is eek expres agayns goddes heeste
  and that in two maneres
  corporeel or spiritueel
  
   corporeel
  as for to take thy neighebores catel agayn his wyl
  
   be it by force or by sleighte
  be it by met or by mesure
  
  800 by stelyng eek of false enditementz upon hym
  and in borwynge of thy neighebores catel
  
  800a in entente nevere to payen it agayn
  and semblable thynges
  
   espiritueel thefte is sacrilege
  that is to seyn
  hurtynge of hooly thynges
  or of thynges sacred to crist
  in two maneres
  
   by reson of the hooly place
  as chirches or chirche hawes
  
   for which every vileyns synne that men doon in swiche places may be cleped sacrilege
  or every violence in the semblable places
  
   also
  they that withdrawen falsly the rightes that longen to hooly chirche
  
   and pleynly and generally
  sacrilege is to reven hooly thyng fro hooly place
  
   or unhooly thyng out of hooly place
  or hooly thing out of unhooly place
  
   now shul ye understonde that the releevynge of avarice is misericorde
  and pitee largely taken
  
   and men myghten axe why that misericorde and pitee is releevynge of avarice
  
   certes
  the avricious man sheweth no pitee ne misericorde to the nedeful man
  for he deliteth hym 
   in the kepynge of his tresor
  and nat in the rescowynge ne releevynge of his evene cristen
  and therfore speke i first of misericorde
  
   thanne is misericorde
  as seith the philosophre
  a vertu 
   by which the corage of a man is stired by the mysese of hym that is mysesed
  
   upon which misericorde folweth pitee in parfournynge of charitable werkes of misericorde
  
   and certes
  thise thynges moeven a man to the misericorde of jhesu crist
  
   that he yaf hymself for oure gilt
  and suffred deeth for misericorde
  and forgaf us oure originale synnes
  
   and therby relessed us fro the peynes of helle
  and amenused the peynes of purgatorie by penitence
  
   and yeveth grace wel to do
  and atte laste the blisse of hevene
  
  810 the speces of misericorde been
  as for to lene and for to yeve
  and to foryeven and relesse
  
  810a and for to han pitee in herte and compassioun of the meschief of his evene cristene
  and eek to chastise
  there as nede is
  
   another manere of remedie agayns avarice is resonable largesse
  but soothly
  heere bihoveth the consideracioun of the grace of jhesu crist
  
   and of his temporeel goodes
  and eek of the goodes perdurables that crist yaf to us
  
   and to han remembrance of the deeth that he shal receyve
  he noot whanne
  where
  ne how
  
   and eek that he shal forgon al that he hath
  save oonly that he hath despended in goode werkes
  
   but for as muche as som folk been unmesurable
  men oghten eschue fool largesse
  that men clepen wast
  
   certes
  he that is fool large ne yeveth nat his catel
  but he leseth his catel
  
   soothly
  what thyng that he yeveth for veyne glorie
  as to mynstrals and to folk for to beren his renoun 
   in the world
  he hath synne therof and noon almesse
  
   certes
  he leseth foule his good that ne seketh with the yifte of his good nothyng but synne
  
   he is lyk to an hors that seketh 
   rather to drynken drovy or trouble water than for to drynken water of the clere welle
  
   and for as muchel as they yeven ther as they sholde nat yeven
  to hem aperteneth 
   thilke malisoun that crist shal yeven at the day of doom to hem that shullen been dampned
  
   after avarice comth glotonye
  which is expres eek agayn the comandement of god
  glotonye is unmesurable appetit to ete or to drynke
  
   or elles to doon ynogh to the unmesurable appetit and desordeynee coveitise to eten or to drynke
  
   this synne corrumped al this world
  as is wel shewed in the synne of adam and of eve
  
   looke eek what seith seint paul of glotonye
  
  820 
 manye
 
  seith saint paul
  
 goon
  of whiche i have ofte seyd to yow
  
  820a and now i seye it wepynge
  that been the enemys of the croys of crist
  of whiche the ende is deeth
  
  820b and of whiche hire wombe is hire god
  and hire glorie in confusioun of hem that so savouren erthely thynges
 
  
   he that is usaunt to this synne of glotonye
  he ne may no synne withstonde
  
   he moot been in servage of alle vices
  for it is the develes hoord ther he hideth hym and resteth
  
   this synne hath manye speces
  the firste is dronkenesse
  that is the horrible sepulture of mannes resoun
  
   and therfore
  whan a man is dronken
  he hath lost his resoun
  and this is deedly synne
  
   but soothly
  whan that a man is nat wont to strong drynke
  and peraventure ne knoweth nat the strengthe of the drynke
  
   or hath feblesse in his heed
  or hath travailed
  thurgh which he drynketh the moore
  al be he sodeynly caught with drynke
  
   it is no deedly synne
  but venyal
  
   the seconde spece of glotonye is that the spirit of a man wexeth al trouble
  
   for dronkenesse bireveth hym the discrecioun of his wit
  
   the thridde spece of glotonye is whan a man devoureth his mete and hath no rightful manere of etynge
  
   the fourthe is whan
  thurgh the grete habundaunce of his mete
  the humours in his body been distempred
  
   the fifthe is foryetelnesse by to muchel drynkynge
  for which somtyme 
   a man foryeteth er the morwe what he dide at even
  or on the nyght biforn
  
   in oother manere been distinct the speces of glotonye
  after seint gregorie
  the firste is for to ete biforn tyme to ete
  
   the seconde is whan a man get hym to delicaat mete or drynke
  
   the thridde is whan men taken to muche over mesure
  the fourthe is curiositee
  with greet entente to maken and apparaillen his mete
  
   the fifthe is for to eten to gredily
  
  830 thise been the fyve fyngres of the develes hand
  by whiche he draweth folk to synne
  
   agayns glotonye is the remedie abstinence
  as seith galien
  but that holde i nat meritorie
  
   if he do it oonly for the heele of his body
  seint augustyn wole that abstinence be doon for vertu and with pacience
  
   
 abstinence
 
  he seith
  
 is litel worth but if a man have good wil therto
  
   and but it be enforced by pacience and by charitee
  and that men doon it for godes sake
  
   and in hope to have the blisse of hevene
 
  
   the felawes of abstinence been attemperaunce
  that holdeth the meene in alle thynges
  eek shame
  that eschueth alle deshonestee
  
   suffisance
  that seketh no riche metes ne drynkes
  ne dooth no fors of to outrageous apparailynge of mete
  
   mesure also
  that restreyneth by resoun the deslavee appetit of etynge
  sobrenesse also
  that restreyneth the outrage of drynke
  
   sparynge also
  that restreyneth the delicaat ese to sitte longe at his mete and softely
  
   wherfore some folk stonden of hir owene wyl to eten at the lasse leyser
  
   after glotonye thanne comth lecherie
  for thise two synnes been so ny cosyns that ofte tyme they wol nat departe
  
   god woot
  this synne is ful displesaunt thyng to god
  for he seyde hymself
  
   
 do no lecherie
 
  and therfore he putte grete peynes agayns this synne in the olde lawe
  
   if womman thral were taken in this synne
  she sholde be beten with staves to the deeth
  
   and if she were a gentil womman
  she sholde be slayn with 
   stones
  and if she were a bisshoppes doghter
  she sholde been brent
  by goddes comandement
  
   forther over
  by the synne of lecherie god dreynte al the world at the diluge
  
   and after that he brente fyve citees with thonder leyt
  and sank hem into helle
  
  840 now lat us speke thanne of thilke stynkynge synne of lecherie that men clepe avowtrie of wedded folk
  
  840a that is to seyn
  if that oon of hem be wedded
  or elles bothe
  
   seint john seith that avowtiers shullen been in helle
  in a stank brennynge of fyr and of brymston 
      in fyr for hire lecherye
  in brymston for the stynk of hire ordure
  
   certes
  the brekynge of this sacrement is an horrible thyng
  
   it was maked of god hymself in paradys
  and confermed by jhesu crist
  as witnesseth seint mathew in the gospel
  
   
 a man shal lete fader and mooder and taken hym to his wif
  and they shullen be two in o flessh
 
  
   this sacrement bitokneth the knyttynge togidre of crist and of hooly chirche
  
   and nat oonly that god forbad avowtrie in dede
  but eek he comanded that thou sholdest nat coveite thy neighebores wyf
  
   
 in this heeste
 
  seith seint augustyn
  
 is forboden alle manere coveitise to doon lecherie
 
  lo
  what seith seint mathew in the gospel
  that 
   
 whoso seeth a womman to coveitise of his lust
  he hath doon lecherie with hire in his herte
 
  
   heere may ye seen that nat oonly the dede of this synne is forboden
  but eek the desir to doon that synne
  
   this cursed synne anoyeth grevousliche hem that it haunten
  and first to hire soule
  
   for he obligeth it to synne and to peyne of deeth that is perdurable
  
   unto the body anoyeth it grevously also
  for it dreyeth hym
  and wasteth him
  and shent hym
  and of his blood 
   he maketh sacrifice to the feend of helle
  it wasteth eek his catel and his substaunce
  
   and certes
  if it be a foul thyng a man to waste his catel on wommen
  
   yet is it a fouler thyng whan that
  for swich ordure
  wommen dispenden upon men hir catel and substaunce
  
  850 this synne
  as seith the prophete
  bireveth man and womman hir goode fame and al hire honour
  
  850a and it is ful plesaunt to the devel
  for therby wynneth he the mooste partie of this world
  
   and right as a marchant deliteth hym moost in chaffare that he hath moost avantage of
  
   right so deliteth the fend in this ordure
  
   this is that oother hand of the devel with fyve fyngres to cacche the peple to his vileynye
  
   the firste fynger is the fool lookynge of the fool womman and of the fool man
  that sleeth
  right 
   as the basilicok sleeth folk by the venym of his sighte
  for the coveitise of eyen folweth the coveitise of the herte
  
   the seconde fynger is the vileyns touchynge in wikkede manere
  
   and therfore seith salomon that 
 whoso toucheth and handleth a womman
  he fareth lyk 
   hym that handleth the scorpioun that styngeth and sodeynly sleeth thurgh his envenymynge
 
  as whoso toucheth warm pych
  it shent his fyngres
  
   the thridde is foule wordes
  that fareth lyk fyr
  that right anon brenneth the herte
  
   the fourthe fynger is the kissynge
  and trewely he were a greet fool 
   that wolde kisse the mouth of a brennynge oven or of a fourneys
  
   and moore fooles been they that kissen in vileynye
  for that mouth is the mouth of helle
  
   and namely thise olde dotardes holours
  yet wol they kisse
  though they may nat do
  and smatre hem
  
   certes
  they been lyk to houndes
  for an hound
  whan he comth by the roser or by othere  bushes 
  
   though he may nat pisse
  yet wole he heve up his leg and make a contenaunce to pisse
  
   and for that many man weneth that he may nat synne for no likerousnesse that he dooth with his wyf
  
   certes
  that opinion is fals
  god woot
  a man may sleen hymself with his owene knyf
  
   and make hymselve dronken of his owene tonne
  
  860 certes
  be it wyf
  be it child
  
  860a or any worldly thyng that he loveth biforn god
  it is his mawmet
  and he is an ydolastre
  
   man sholde loven hys wyf by discrecioun
  paciently and atemprely
  and thanne is she as though it were his suster
  
   the fifthe fynger of the develes hand is the stynkynge dede of leccherie
  
   certes
  the fyve fyngres of glotonie the feend put in the wombe of a man
  
   and with his fyve fingres of lecherie he gripeth hym by the reynes for to throwen hym into the fourneys of helle
  
   ther as they shul han the fyr and the wormes that evere shul lasten
  and wepynge and wailynge
  sharp hunger and thurst
  
    and  grymnesse of develes
  that shullen al totrede hem withouten respit and withouten ende
  
   of leccherie
  as i seyde
  sourden diverse speces
  as fornicacioun
  that is bitwixe man and womman that been nat maried
  
   and this is deedly synne and agayns nature
  
   al that is enemy and destruccioun to nature is agayns nature
  
   parfay
  the resoun of a man telleth eek hym wel that it is deedly synne
  for as muche as god forbad leccherie
  
   and seint paul yeveth hem the regne that nys dewe to no wight but to hem that doon deedly synne
  
   another synne of leccherie is to bireve a mayden of hir maydenhede
  for he that so dooth
  
   certes
  he casteth a mayden out of the hyeste degree that is in this present lif 
   and bireveth hire thilke precious fruyt that the book clepeth the hundred fruyt
  
   i ne kan seye it noon ootherweyes in englissh
  but in latyn it highte centesimus fructus
  
  870 certes
  he that so dooth is cause of manye damages and vileynyes
  mo than any man kan rekene
  
  870a right as he somtyme is cause of alle damages that beestes don in the feeld
  that breketh the hegge or the closure
  
  870b thurgh which he destroyeth that may nat been restoored
  
   for certes
  namoore may maydenhede be restoored than an arm that is smyten fro the body may retourne agayn to wexe
  
   she may have mercy
  this woot i wel
  if she do penitence
  but nevere shal it be that she nas corrupt
  
   and al be it so that i have spoken somwhat of avowtrie
  
   it is good to shewen mo perils that longen to avowtrie
  for to eschue that foule synne
  
   avowtrie in latyn is for to seyn approchynge of oother mannes bed
  
   thurgh which tho that whilom weren o flessh abawndone hir bodyes to othere persones
  
   of this synne
  as seith the wise man
  folwen manye harmes
  
   first
  brekynge of feith
  and certes in feith is the keye of cristendom
  
   and whan that feith is broken and lorn
  soothly cristendom stant veyn and withouten fruyt
  
   this synne is eek a thefte
  for thefte generally is for to reve a wight his thyng agayns his wille
  
   certes
  this is the fouleste thefte that may be
  whan a womman steleth hir body from hir housbonde 
   and yeveth it to hire holour to defoulen hire
  and steleth hir soule fro crist and yeveth it to the devel
  
   this is a fouler thefte than for to breke a chirche and stele the chalice
  
   for thise avowtiers breken the temple of god spiritually
  and stelen the vessel of grace
  that is the body and the soule
  
   for which crist shal destroyen hem
  as seith seint paul
  
  880 soothly
  of this thefte douted gretly joseph
  whan that his lordes wyf preyed hym of vileynye
  whan he seyde
  
  880a 
 lo
  my lady
  how my lord hath take to me under my warde al that he hath in this world
  
  880b ne no thyng of his thynges is out of my power
  but oonly ye
  that been his wyf
  
   and how sholde i thanne do this wikkednesse
  and synne so horribly agayns god and agayns my lord
  
   god it forbeede
 
  allas
  al to litel is swich trouthe now yfounde
  
   the thridde harm is the filthe thurgh which they breken the comandement of god
  and defoulen the auctour of matrimoyne
  that is crist
  
   for certes
  in so muche as the sacrement of mariage is so noble and so digne
  so muche is it gretter synne 
   for to breken it
  for god made mariage in paradys
  in the estaat of innocence
  to multiplye mankynde to the service of god
  
   and therfore is the brekynge therof the moore grevous
  of which brekynge comen false heires ofte tyme
  that wrongfully ocupien folkes heritages
  
   and therfore wol crist putte hem out of the regne of hevene
  that is heritage to goode folk
  
   of this brekynge comth eek ofte tyme that folk unwar wedden or synnen with hire owene kynrede
  and namely thilke harlotes that haunten 
   bordels of thise fool wommen
  that mowe be likned to a commune gong
  where as men purgen hire ordure
  
   what seye we eek of putours that lyven by the horrible synne of putrie
  and constreyne wommen to yelden hem a certeyn rente 
   of hire bodily puterie
  ye
  somtyme of his owene wyf or his child
  as doon thise bawdes
  certes
  thise been cursede synnes
  
   understoond eek that avowtrie is set gladly in the ten comandementz bitwixe thefte and manslaughtre
  
   for it is the gretteste thefte that may be
  for it is thefte of body and of soule
  
   and it is lyk to homycide
  for it kerveth atwo and breketh atwo hem that first were maked o flessh
  
   and therfore
  by the olde lawe of god
  they sholde be slayn
  
   but nathelees
  by the lawe of jhesu crist
  that is lawe of pitee
  whan he seyde to the womman 
   that was founden in avowtrie
  and sholde han been slayn with stones
  after the wyl of the jewes
  as was hir lawe
  
   
 go
 
  quod jhesu crist
  
 and have namoore wyl to synne
 
  or
  
 wille namoore to do synne
 
  
  890 soothly the vengeaunce of avowtrie is awarded to the peynes of helle
  but if so be that it be destourbed by penitence
  
   yet been ther mo speces of this cursed synne
  as whan that oon of hem is religious
  or elles bothe
  
   or of folk that been entred into ordre
  as subdekne
  or dekne
  or preest
  or hospitaliers
  
   and evere the hyer that he is in ordre
  the gretter is the synne
  
   the thynges that gretly agreggen hire synne is the brekynge of hire avow of chastitee
  whan they receyved the ordre
  
   and forther over
  sooth is that hooly ordre is chief of al the tresorie of god 
   and his especial signe and mark of chastitee to shewe that they been joyned to chastitee
  
   which that is the moost precious lyf that is
  
   and thise ordred folk been specially titled to god
  and of the special meignee of god
  
   for which
  whan they doon deedly synne
  they been the special traytours of god and of his peple
  
   for they lyven of the peple
  to preye for the peple
  
   and while they ben suche traitours
  here preyer avayleth nat to the peple
  
   preestes been aungels
  as by the dignitee of hir mysterye
  
   but for sothe
  seint paul seith that sathanas transformeth hym in an aungel of light
  
   soothly
  the preest that haunteth deedly synne
  he may be likned to the aungel of derknesse transformed in the aungel of light
  
   he semeth aungel of light
  but for sothe he is aungel of derknesse
  
   swiche preestes been the sones of helie
  
   as sheweth in the book of kynges
  that they weren the sones of belial    that is
  the devel
  
   belial is to seyn
  
 withouten juge
 
  and so faren they
  hem thynketh they been free and han no juge
  
   namoore than hath a free bole that taketh which cow that hym liketh in the town
  
   so faren they by wommen
  for right as a free bole is ynough for al a toun
  
   right so is a wikked preest corrupcioun ynough for al a parisshe
  or for al a contree
  
  900 thise preestes
  as seith the book
  ne konne nat the mysterie of preesthod to the peple
  ne god ne knowe they nat
  
  900a they ne helde hem nat apayd
  as seith the book
  of soden flessh that was to hem offred
  
  900b but they tooke by force the flessh that is rawe
  
   certes
  so thise shrewes ne holden hem nat apayed of roosted flessh and sode flessh
  
   with which the peple feden hem in greet reverence
  but they wole have raw flessh of folkes wyves and hir doghtres
  
   and certes
  thise wommen that consenten to hire harlotrie doon greet wrong to crist
  
   and to hooly chirche
  and alle halwes
  and to alle soules
  
   for they bireven alle thise hym that sholde worshipe crist and hooly chirche and preye for cristene soules
  
   and therfore han swiche preestes
  and hire lemmanes eek that consenten to hir leccherie
  
   the malisoun of al the court cristien
  til they come to amendement
  
   the thridde spece of avowtrie is somtyme bitwixe a man and his wyf
  and that is 
   whan they take no reward in hire assemblynge but oonly to hire flesshly delit
  as seith seint jerome
  
   and ne rekken of nothyng but that they been assembled
  
   by cause that they been maried
  al is good ynough
  as thynketh to hem
  
   but in swich folk hath the devel power
  as seyde the aungel raphael to thobie
  
   for in hire assemblynge they putten jhesu crist out of hire herte and yeven hemself to alle ordure
  
   the fourthe spece is the assemblee of hem that been of hire kynrede
  or of hem that been of oon affynytee
  
   or elles with hem with whiche hir fadres or hir kynrede han deled in the synne of lecherie
  
   this synne maketh hem lyk to houndes
  that taken no kep to kynrede
  
   and certes
  parentele is in two maneres
  outher goostly or flesshly
  goostly
  as for to deelen with his godsibbes
  
   for right so as he that engendreth a child is his flesshly fader
  right so is his godfader his fader espiritueel
  
   for which a womman may in no lasse synne assemblen with hire godsib than with hire owene flesshly brother
  
  910 the fifthe spece is thilke abhomynable synne
  of which that no man unnethe oghte speke ne write
  
  910a nathelees it is openly reherced in holy writ
  
   this cursednesse doon men and wommen in diverse entente and in diverse manere
  but though that hooly writ speke of horrible synne
  
   certes hooly writ may nat been defouled
  namoore than the sonne that shyneth on the mixne
  
   another synne aperteneth to leccherie
  that comth in slepynge
  and this synne cometh ofte to hem that been maydenes
  
   and eek to hem that been corrupt
  and this synne men clepen polucioun
  that comth in foure maneres
  
   somtyme of langwissynge of body
  for the humours been to ranke and to habundaunt in the body of man
  
   somtyme of infermetee
  for the fieblesse of the vertu retentif
  as phisik maketh mencion
  somtyme for surfeet of mete and drynke
  
   and somtyme of vileyns thoghtes that been enclosed in mannes mynde whan he gooth to slepe
  which may nat been withoute synne
  
   for which men moste kepen hem wisely
  or elles may men synnen ful grevously
  
   now comth the remedie agayns leccherie
  and that is generally chastitee and continence
  
   that restreyneth alle the desordeynee moevynges that comen of flesshly talentes
  
   and evere the gretter merite shal he han that moost restreyneth the wikkede eschawfynges of the  ardour  of this synne
  
   and this is in two maneres    that is to seyn
  chastitee in mariage
  and chastitee of widwehod
  
   now shaltow understonde that matrimoyne is leefful assemblynge of man and of womman that receyven by vertu of the sacrement the boond 
   thurgh which they may nat be departed in al hir lyf    that is to seyn
  whil that they lyven bothe
  
   this
  as seith the book
  is a ful greet sacrement
  
   god maked it
  as i have seyd
  in paradys
  and wolde hymself be born in mariage
  
   and for to halwen mariage he was at a weddynge
  where as he turned water into wyn
  
   which was the firste miracle that he wroghte in erthe biforn his disciples
  
  920 trewe effect of mariage clenseth fornicacioun and replenysseth hooly chirche of good lynage
  for that is the ende of mariage
  
  920a and it chaungeth deedly synne into venial synne bitwixe hem that been ywedded
  
  920b and maketh the hertes al oon of hem that been ywedded
  as wel as the bodies
  
   this is verray mariage
  that was establissed by god
  er that synne bigan
  whan natureel lawe was in his right poynt in paradys
  
   and it was ordeyned that o man sholde have but o womman
  and o womman but o man
  
   as seith seint augustyn
  by manye resouns
  
   first
  for mariage is figured bitwixe crist and holy chirche
  and that oother is for a man is heved of a womman
  
   algate
  by ordinaunce it sholde be so
  
   for if a womman hadde mo men than oon
  thanne sholde she have moo hevedes than oon
  and 
   that were an horrible thyng biforn god
  and eek a womman ne myghte nat plese to many folk at oones
  
   and also ther ne sholde nevere be pees ne reste amonges hem
  for everich wolde axen his owene thyng
  
   and forther over
  no man ne sholde knowe his owene engendrure
  ne who sholde have his heritage
  
   and the womman sholde been the lasse biloved fro the tyme that she were conjoynt to many men
  
   now comth how that a man sholde bere hym with his wif
  and namely in two thynges
  
   that is to seyn
  in suffraunce and reverence
  as shewed crist whan he made first womman
  
   for he ne made hire nat of the heved of adam
  for she sholde nat clayme to greet lordshipe
  
   for ther as the womman hath the maistrie
  she maketh to muche desray
  
   ther neden none ensamples of this
  the experience of day by day oghte suffise
  
   also
  certes
  god ne made nat womman of the foot of adam
  for she ne sholde nat been holden to lowe
  
   for she kan nat paciently suffre
  but god made womman of the ryb of adam
  for womman sholde be felawe unto man
  
   man sholde bere hym to his wyf in feith
  in trouthe
  and in love
  
   as seith seint paul
  that a man sholde loven his wyf as crist loved hooly chirche
  
   that loved it so wel that he deyde for it
  so sholde a man for his wyf
  if it were nede
  
  930 now how that a womman sholde be subget to hire housbonde
  that telleth seint peter
  first
  in obedience
  
   and eek
  as seith the decree
  a womman that is wyf
  as longe as she is a wyf
  
   she hath noon auctoritee to swere ne to bere witnesse withoute leve of hir housbonde
  
   that is hire lord
  algate
  he sholde be so by resoun
  
   she sholde eek serven hym in alle honestee
  and been attempree of hire array
  
   i woot wel that they sholde setten hire entente to plesen hir housbondes
  but nat by hire queyntise of array
  
   seint jerome seith that 
 wyves that been apparailled in silk and in precious purpre ne mowe nat clothen hem in jhesu crist
 
  
   loke what seith seint john eek in thys matere
  
   seint gregorie eek seith that 
 no wight seketh precious array but oonly for veyne glorie
  to been honoured the moore biforn the peple
 
  
   it is a greet folye
  a womman to have a fair array outward and in hirself be foul inward
  
   a wyf sholde eek be mesurable in lookynge and in berynge and in lawghynge
  and discreet in alle hire wordes and hire dedes
  
   and aboven alle worldly thyng she sholde loven hire housbonde with al hire herte
  and to hym be trewe of hir body
  
   so sholde an housbonde eek be to his wyf
  for sith that al the body is the housbondes
  
   so sholde hire herte been
  or elles ther is bitwixe hem two
  as in that
  no parfit mariage
  
   thanne shal men understonde that for thre thynges a man and his wyf flesshly mowen assemble
  
   the firste is in entente of engendrure of children to the service of god
  for certes that is the cause final of matrimoyne
  
  940 another cause is to yelden everich of hem to oother the dette of hire bodies
  
  940a for neither of hem hath power of his owene body
  the thridde is for to eschewe leccherye and vileynye
  
  940b the ferthe is for sothe deedly synne
  
   as to the firste
  it is meritorie
  the seconde also
  for
  as seith the decree
  that 
   she hath merite of chastitee that yeldeth to hire housbonde the dette of hir body
  
   ye
  though it be agayn hir likynge and the lust of hire herte
  
   the thridde manere is venyal synne
  and
  trewely
  scarsly may ther any of thise be withoute venial synne
  
   for the corrupcion and for the delit
  
   the fourthe manere is for to understonde
  as if they assemble oonly for amorous love and for noon of the foreseyde causes
  
   but for to accomplice thilke brennynge delit
  they rekke nevere how ofte
  
   soothly it is deedly synne
  and yet
  with sorwe
  somme folk wol peynen hem moore to doon than to hire appetit suffiseth
  
   the seconde manere of chastitee is for to been a clene wydewe
  
   and eschue the embracynges of man
  and desiren the embracynge of jhesu crist
  
   thise been tho that han been wyves and han forgoon hire housbondes
  
   and eek wommen that han doon leccherie and been releeved by penitence
  
   and certes
  if that a wyf koude kepen hire al chaast by licence of hir housbonde
  
   so that she yeve nevere noon occasion that he agilte
  it were to hire a greet merite
  
   thise manere wommen that observen chastitee moste be clene in herte as wel as in body and in thought
  
   and mesurable in clothynge and in contenaunce
  and been abstinent in etynge and drynkynge
  in spekynge
  and in dede
  
   they been the vessel or the boyste of the blissed magdelene
  that fulfilleth hooly chirche of good odour
  
   the thridde manere of chastitee is virginitee
  and it bihoveth that she be hooly in herte and clene of body
  
   thanne is she spouse to jhesu crist
  and she is the lyf of angeles
  
   she is the preisynge of this world
  and she is as thise martirs in egalitee
  
   she hath in hire that tonge may nat telle ne herte thynke
  
  950 virginitee baar oure lord jhesu crist
  and virgine was hymselve
  
   another remedie agayns leccherie is specially to withdrawen swiche thynges as yeve occasion to thilke vileynye
  as ese
  etynge
  and drynkynge
  
   for certes
  whan the pot boyleth strongly
  the beste remedie is to withdrawe the fyr
  
   slepynge longe in greet quiete is eek a greet norice to leccherie
  
   another remedie agayns leccherie is that a man or a womman eschue the compaignye of hem 
   by whiche he douteth to be tempted
  for al be it so that the dede be withstonden
  yet is ther greet temptacioun
  
   soothly
  a whit wal
  although it ne brenne noght fully by stikynge of a candele
  yet is the wal blak of the leyt
  
   ful ofte tyme i rede that no man truste in his owene perfeccioun
  
   but he be stronger than sampson
  and hoolier than david
  and wiser than salomon
  
   now after that i have declared yow
  as i kan
  the sevene deedly synnes
  
   and somme of hire braunches and hire remedies
  soothly
  if i koude
  i wolde telle yow the ten comandementz
  
   but so heigh a doctrine i lete to divines
  nathelees
  i hope to god
  
   they been touched in this tretice
  everich of hem alle
  
   now for as muche as the seconde partie of penitence stant in confessioun of mouth
  
   as i bigan in the firste chapitre
  i seye
  seint augustyn seith
  
   
 synne is every word and every dede
  and al that men coveiten
  agayn the lawe of jhesu crist
  
   and this is for to synne in herte
  in mouth
  and in dede
  by thy fyve wittes
  
   that been sighte
  herynge
  smellynge
  tastynge or savourynge
  and feelynge
 
  
  960 now is it good to understonde the circumstances that agreggen muchel every synne
  
   thou shalt considere what thow art that doost the synne
  
   wheither thou be male or femele
  yong or oold
  gentil or thral
  
   free or servant
  hool or syk
  wedded or sengle
  ordred or unordred
  wys or fool
  clerk or seculeer
  
   if she be of thy kynrede
  bodily or goostly
  or noon
  
   if any of thy kynrede have synned with hire
  or noon
  and manye mo thinges
  
   another circumstaunce is this
  wheither it be doon in fornicacioun or in avowtrie or noon
  incest or noon
  mayden or noon
  
   in manere of homicide or noon
  horrible grete synnes or smale
  and how longe thou hast continued in synne
  
   the thridde circumstaunce is the place ther thou hast do synne
  wheither in oother mennes hous or in thyn owene
  
   in feeld or in chirche or in chirchehawe
  in chirche dedicaat or noon
  
   for if the chirche be halwed
  and man or womman 
   spille his kynde inwith that place by wey of synne or by wikked temptacioun
  
   the chirche is entredited til it be reconsiled by the bysshop
  
   and the preest sholde be enterdited that dide swich a vileynye
  to terme of al his lif he sholde namoore synge masse
  
   and if he dide
  he sholde doon deedly synne at every time that he so songe masse
  
   the fourthe circumstaunce is by whiche mediatours
  or by whiche messagers
  as for enticement
  or for consentement to bere compaignye with felaweshipe
  
   for many a wrecche
  for to bere compaignye
  wol go to the devel of helle
  
   wherfore they that eggen or consenten to the synne been parteners of the synne
  and of the dampnacioun of the synnere
  
   the fifthe circumstaunce is how manye tymes that he hath synned
  
   if it be in his mynde
  and how ofte that he hath falle
  
  970 for he that ofte falleth in synne
  he despiseth the mercy of god
  and encreesseth hys synne
  and is unkynde to crist
  
  970a and he wexeth the moore fieble to withstonde synne
  and synneth the moore lightly
  
   and the latter ariseth
  and is the moore eschew for to shryven hym
  and namely
  to hym that is his confessour
  
   for which that folk
  whan they falle agayn in hir olde folies
  outher they forleten hir olde confessours al outrely 
   or elles they departen hir shrift in diverse places
  but soothly
  swich departed shrift deserveth no mercy of god of his synnes
  
   the sixte circumstaunce is why that a man synneth
  as by which temptacioun
  and if hymself procure thilke temptacioun
  
   or by the excitynge of oother folk
  or if he synne with a womman by force
  or by hire owene assent
  
   or if the womman
  maugree hir hed
  hath been afforced
  or noon
  this shal she telle
  
   for coveitise
  or for poverte
  and if it was hire procurynge
  or noon
  and swich manere harneys
  
   the seventhe circumstaunce is in what manere he hath doon his synne
  
   or how that she hath suffred that folk han doon to hire
  
   and the same shal the man telle pleynly with alle circumstaunces
  and wheither he hath synned with comune bordel wommen or noon
  
   or doon his synne in hooly tymes or noon
  in fastyng tymes or noon
  or biforn his shrifte
  or after his latter shrifte
  
   and hath peraventure broken therfore his penance enjoyned
  by whos help and whos conseil
  by sorcerie or craft
  al moste be toold
  
   alle thise thynges
  after that they been grete or smale
  engreggen the conscience of man
  
   and eek the preest
  that is thy juge
  may the bettre been avysed of his juggement 
   in yevynge of thy penaunce
  and that is after thy contricioun
  
  980 for understond wel that after tyme that a man hath defouled his baptesme by synne
  
  980a if he wole come to salvacioun
  ther is noon other wey but by penitence and shrifte and satisfaccioun
  
   and namely by the two
  if ther be a confessour to which he may shriven hym
  
   and the thridde
  if he have lyf to parfournen it
  
   thanne shal man looke and considere that if he wole maken a trewe and a profitable confessioun
  ther moste be foure condiciouns
  
   first
  it moot been in sorweful bitternesse of herte
  as seyde the kyng ezechias to god
  
   
 i wol remembre me alle the yeres of my lif in bitternesse of myn herte
 
  
   this condicioun of bitternesse hath fyve signes
  the firste is that confessioun moste be shamefast
  nat for to covere ne hyden his synne
  
   for he hath agilt his god and defouled his soule
  
   and herof seith seint augustyn
  
 the herte travailleth for shame of his synne
 
  
   and for he hath greet shamefastnesse
  he is digne to have greet mercy of god
  
   swich was the confessioun of the publican that wolde nat heven up his eyen to hevene
  
   for he hadde offended god of hevene
  for which shamefastnesse he hadde anon the mercy of god
  
   and therof seith seint augustyn that swich shamefast folk been next foryevenesse and remissioun
  
   another signe is humylitee in confessioun
  of which seith seint peter
  
   
 humbleth yow under the myght of god
 
  the hond of god is myghty in confessioun
  for 
   therby god foryeveth thee thy synnes
  for he allone hath the power
  
   and this humylitee shal been in herte and in signe outward
  for right as he hath humylitee to god in his herte
  
   right so sholde he humble his body outward to the preest
  that sit in goddes place
  
  990 for which in no manere
  sith that crist is sovereyn
  and the preest meene and mediatour bitwixe crist and the synnere
  
  990a and the synnere is the laste by wey of resoun
  
   thanne sholde nat the synnere sitte as heighe as his confessour
  but knele biforn hym or at his feet
  
   but if maladie destourbe it
  for he shal nat taken kep who sit there
  but in whos place that he sitteth
  
   a man that hath trespased to a lord
  and comth for to axe mercy and maken his accord
  
   and set him doun anon by the lord
  
   men wolde holden hym outrageous
  and nat worthy so soone for to have remissioun ne mercy
  
   the thridde signe is how that thy shrift sholde be ful of teeris
  if man may
  
   and if man may nat wepe with his bodily eyen
  lat hym wepe in herte
  
   swich was the confession of seint peter
  for after that he hadde forsake jhesu crist
  he wente out and weep ful bitterly
  
   the fourthe signe is that he ne lette nat for shame to shewen his confessioun
  
   swich was the confessioun of the magdalene
  that ne spared for no shame of hem 
   that weren atte feeste
  for to go to oure lord jhesu crist and biknowe to hym hire synne
  
   the fifthe signe is that a man or a womman be obeisant to receyven the penaunce that hym is enjoyned for his synnes
  
   for certes
  jhesu crist
  for the giltes of o man
  was obedient to the deeth
  
   the seconde condicion of verray confession is that it be hastily doon
  
   for certes
  if a man hadde a deedly wounde
  evere the lenger that he taried to warisshe hymself
  
   the moore wolde it corrupte and haste hym to his deeth
  and eek the wounde wolde be the wors for to heele
  
   and right so fareth synne that longe tyme is in a man unshewed
  
  1000 certes
  a man oghte hastily shewen his synnes for manye causes
  as for drede of deeth
  that cometh ofte sodeynly
  
  1000a and no certeyn what tyme it shal be
  ne in what place
  and eek the drecchynge of o synne draweth in another
  
   and eek the lenger that he tarieth
  the ferther he is fro crist
  and if he abide to his laste day
  scarsly 
   may he shryven hym or remembre hym of his synnes or repenten hym
  for the grevous maladie of his deeth
  
   and for as muche as he ne hath nat in his lyf herkned jhesu crist 
   whanne he hath spoken
  he shal crie to jhesu crist at his laste day
  and scarsly wol he herkne hym
  
   and understond that this condicioun moste han foure thynges
  thi shrift moste be purveyed bifore and avysed
  
   for wikked haste dooth no profit
  and that a man konne shryve hym of his synnes
  
   be it of pride
  or of envye
  and so forth with the speces and circumstances
  
   and that he have comprehended in hys mynde the nombre and the greetnesse of his synnes
  
   and how longe that he hath leyn in synne
  
   and eek that he be contrit of his synnes
  and in stidefast purpos
  
   by the grace of god
  nevere eft to falle in synne
  
   and eek that he drede and countrewaite hymself
  that he fle the occasiouns of synne to whiche he is enclyned
  
   also thou shalt shryve thee of alle thy synnes to o man
  and nat a parcel to o man and a parcel to another
  
   that is to understonde
  in entente to departe thy confessioun
  as for shame or drede
  for it nys but stranglynge of thy soule
  
   for certes jhesu crist is entierly al good
  in hym nys noon imperfeccioun
  
   and therfore outher he foryeveth al parfitly or elles never a deel
  
   i seye nat that if thow be assigned to the penitauncer for certein synne
  
   that thow art bounde to shewen hym al the remenaunt of thy synnes
  of whiche thow hast be shryven of thy curaat
  
   but if it like to thee of thyn humylitee
  this is no departynge of shrifte
  
   ne i seye nat
  ther as i speke of divisioun of confessioun
  that if thou have licence 
   for to shryve thee to a discreet and an honest preest
  where thee liketh
  and by licence of thy curaat
  
   that thow ne mayst wel shryve thee to him of alle thy synnes
  
  1010 but lat no blotte be bihynde
  lat no synne been untoold
  as fer as thow hast remembraunce
  
   and whan thou shalt be shryven to thy curaat
  telle hym eek alle the synnes that thow hast doon 
   syn thou were last yshryven
  this is no wikked entente of divisioun of shrifte
  
   also the verray shrifte axeth certeine condiciouns
  first
  that thow shryve thee by thy free wil
  
   noght constreyned
  ne for shame of folk
  ne for maladie
  ne swiche thynges
  
   for it is resoun that he that trespaseth by his free wyl
  that by his free wyl he confesse his trespas
  
   and that noon oother man telle his synne but he hymself
  
   ne he shal nat nayte ne denye his synne
  ne wratthe hym agayn the preest for his amonestynge to lete synne
  
   the seconde condicioun is that thy shrift be laweful
  that is to seyn
  that 
   thow that shryvest thee and eek the preest that hereth thy confessioun been verraily in the feith of hooly chirche
  
   and that a man ne be nat despeired of the mercy of jhesu crist
  as caym or judas
  
   and eek a man moot accusen hymself of his owene trespas
  and nat another
  
   but he shal blame and wyten hymself and his owene malice of his synne
  and noon oother
  
   but nathelees
  if that another man be occasioun or enticere of his synne
  
   or the estaat of a persone be swich thurgh which his synne is agregged
  or elles that he may nat pleynly shryven 
   hym but he telle the persone with which he hath synned
  thanne may he telle it
  
   so that his entente ne be nat to bakbite the persone
  but oonly to declaren his confessioun
  
   thou ne shalt nat eek make no lesynges in thy confessioun
  for humylitee
  
   peraventure
  to seyn that thou hast doon synnes of whiche thow were nevere gilty
  
  1020 for seint augustyn seith
  
 if thou
  by cause of thyn humylitee
  makest lesynges on thyself
  
  1020a though thow ne were nat in synne biforn
  yet artow thanne in synne thurgh thy lesynges
 
  
   thou most eek shewe thy synne by thyn owene propre mouth
  but thow be woxe dowmb
  and nat by no lettre
  
   for thow that hast doon the synne
  thou shalt have the shame therfore
  
   thow shalt nat eek peynte thy confessioun by faire subtile wordes
  to covere the moore thy synne
  
   for thanne bigilestow thyself
  and nat the preest
  thow most tellen it platly
  be it nevere so foul ne so horrible
  
   thow shalt eek shryve thee to a preest that is discreet to conseille 
   thee
  and eek thou shalt nat shryve thee for veyne glorie
  ne for ypocrisye
  ne for no cause 
   but oonly for the doute of jhesu crist and the heele of thy soule
  
   thow shalt nat eek renne to the preest sodeynly to tellen hym lightly thy synne
  
   as whoso telleth a jape or a tale
  but avysely and with greet devocioun
  
   and generally
  shryve thee ofte
  if thou ofte falle
  ofte thou arise by confessioun
  
   and though thou shryve thee ofter than ones of synne of which thou hast be shryven
  it is the moore merite
  
   and
  as seith seint augustyn
  thow shalt have the moore lightly relessyng and grace of god
  bothe of synne and of peyne
  
   and certes
  oones a yeere atte leeste wey it is laweful for to been housled
  for certes
  oones a yeere alle thynges renovellen
  
   now have i toold yow of verray confessioun
  that is the seconde partie of penitence
  
   the thridde partie of penitence is satisfaccioun
  and that stant moost generally in almesse and in bodily peyne
  
  1030 now been ther thre manere of almesse
  contricion of herte
  where a man offreth hymself to god
  
  1030a another is to han pitee of defaute of his neighebores
  and the thridde is 
  1030b in yevynge of good conseil and comfort
  goostly and bodily
  where men han nede
  and namely in sustenaunce of mannes foode
  
   and tak kep that a man hath nede of thise thinges generally
  he hath nede of foode
  he hath nede of clothyng and herberwe
  
   he hath nede of charitable conseil and visitynge in prisone and in maladie
  and sepulture of his dede body
  
   and if thow mayst nat visite the nedeful with thy persone
  visite hym by thy message and by thy yiftes
  
   thise been general almesses or werkes of charitee 
   of hem that han temporeel richesses or discrecioun in conseilynge
  of thise werkes shaltow heren at the day of doom
  
   thise almesses shaltow doon of thyne owene propre thynges
  and hastily and prively
  if thow mayst
  
   but nathelees
  if thow mayst nat doon it prively
  thow shalt nat forbere to doon almesse though men seen it
  
   so that it be nat doon for thank of the world
  but oonly for thank of jhesu crist
  
   for
  as witnesseth seint mathew
  capitulo quinto
  
 a citee may nat been hyd that is set on a montayne
  
   ne men lighte nat a lanterne and put it under a busshel
  
   but men sette it on a candle stikke to yeve light to the men in the hous
  
   right so shal youre light lighten bifore men
  that they may seen youre goode werkes
  and glorifie youre fader that is in hevene
 
  
   now as to speken of bodily peyne
  it stant in preyeres
  in wakynges
  in fastynges
  in vertuouse techynges of orisouns
  
   and ye shul understonde that orisouns or preyeres is for to seyn a pitous wyl of herte
  
   that redresseth it in god and expresseth it by word outward
  to remoeven harmes and to han thynges espiritueel and durable
  
   and somtyme temporele thynges
  of whiche orisouns
  certes
  in the orison of the pater noster hath jhesu crist enclosed moost thynges
  
  1040 certes
  it is privyleged of thre thynges in his dignytee
  
  1040a for which it is moore digne than any oother preyere
  for that jhesu crist hymself maked it
  
   and it is short
  for it sholde be koud the moore lightly
  and 
   for to withholden it the moore esily in herte
  and helpen hymself the ofter with the orisoun
  
   and for a man sholde be the lasse wery to seyen it
  and for a man may nat excusen hym to lerne it
  
   it is so short and so esy
  and for it comprehendeth in it self alle goode preyeres
  
   the exposicioun of this hooly preyere
  that is so excellent and digne
  i bitake to thise maistres of theologie
  
   save thus muchel wol i seyn
  that whan thow prayest that god sholde foryeve thee thy giltes as 
   thou foryevest hem that agilten to thee
  be ful wel war that thow ne be nat out of charitee
  
   this hooly orison amenuseth eek venyal synne
  and therfore it aperteneth specially to penitence
  
   this preyere moste be trewely seyd
  and in verray feith
  and that men preye to god ordinatly and discreetly and devoutly
  
   and alwey a man shal putten his wyl to be subget to the wille of god
  
   this orisoun moste eek been seyd with greet humblesse and ful pure
  honestly and nat to the anoyaunce of any man or womman
  
   it moste eek been continued with the werkes of charitee
  
   it avayleth eek agayn the vices of the soule
  for
  as seith seint jerome
  
   
 by fastynge been saved the vices of the flessh
  and by preyere the vices of the soule
 
  
   after this
  thou shalt understonde that bodily peyne stant in wakynge
  for jhesu crist seith
  
   
 waketh and preyeth
  that ye ne entre in wikked temptacioun
 
  
   ye shul understanden also that fastynge stant in thre thynges
  in forberynge of bodily mete and drynke
  and in forberynge of worldly jolitee
  
   and in forberynge of deedly synne
  this is to seyn
  that a man shal kepen hym fro deedly synne with al his myght
  
  1050 and thou shalt understanden eek that god ordeyned fastynge
  and to fastynge appertenen foure thinges
  
   largenesse to povre folk
  gladnesse of herte espiritueel
  nat to been angry ne anoyed
  ne grucche for he fasteth
  
   and also resonable houre for to ete
  ete by mesure
  that is for to seyn
  
   a man shal nat ete in untyme
  ne sitte the lenger at his table to ete for he fasteth
  
   thanne shaltow understonde that bodily peyne stant in disciplyne or techynge
  by word
  or by writynge
  or in ensample
  
   also in werynge of heyres
  or of stamyn
  or of haubergeons on hire naked flessh
  for cristes sake
  and swiche manere penances
  
   but war thee wel that swiche manere penaunces on thy flessh ne make nat thyn herte bitter or angry or anoyed of thyself
  
   for bettre is to caste awey thyn heyre
  than for to caste awey the swetenesse of jhesu crist
  
   and therfore seith seint paul
  
 clothe yow
  as they that been chosen of god
  in herte of misericorde
  debonairetee
  suffraunce
  
   and swich manere of clothynge
 
  of whiche jhesu crist is moore apayed than of heyres
  or haubergeouns
  or hauberkes
  
   thanne is discipline eek in knokkynge of thy brest
  in scourgynge with yerdes
  in knelynges
  in tribulacions
  
   in suffrynge paciently wronges that been doon to thee
  
   and eek in pacient suffraunce of maladies
  or lesynge of worldly catel
  or of wyf
  or of child
  or othere freendes
  
   thanne shaltow understonde whiche thynges destourben penaunce
  and this is in foure maneres
  
   that is
  drede
  shame
  hope
  and wanhope
  that is desperacion
  
   and for to speke first of drede
  for which he weneth that he may suffre no penaunce
  
   ther agayns is remedie for to thynke that bodily penaunce is but short and litel at regard of the peyne of helle
  
   that is so crueel and so long that it lasteth withouten ende
  
  1060 now again the shame that a man hath to shryven hym
  
  1060a and namely thise ypocrites that wolden been holden so parfite that they han no nede to shryven hem
  
   agayns that shame sholde a man thynke that
  by wey of resoun
  that he that hath nat been shamed to doon foule thinges
  
   certes hym oghte nat been ashamed to do faire thynges
  and that is confessiouns
  
   a man sholde eek thynke that god seeth and woot alle his thoghtes and alle his werkes
  
   to hym may no thyng been hyd ne covered
  
   men sholden eek remembren hem of the shame that is to come at the day of doom 
   to hem that been nat penitent and shryven in this present lyf
  
   for alle the creatures in hevene
  in erthe
  and in helle shullen seen apertly al that they hyden in this world
  
   now for to speken of the hope of hem that been necligent and slowe to shryven hem
  that stant in two maneres
  
   that oon is that he hopeth for to lyve longe and for to purchacen muche richesse for his delit
  
   and thanne he wol shryven hym
  and
  as he seith
  hym semeth thanne tymely ynough to come to shrifte
  
   another is of surquidrie that he hath in cristes mercy
  
   agayns the firste vice
  he shal thynke that oure lif is in no sikernesse
  
   and eek that alle the richesses in this world ben in aventure and passen as a shadwe on the wal
  
   and
  as seith seint gregorie
  that it aperteneth to the grete rightwisnesse of god that 
   nevere shal the peyne stynte of hem that nevere wolde withdrawen hem fro synne
  hir thankes
  
   but ay continue in synne
  for thilke perpetueel wil to do synne shul they han perpetueel peyne
  
  1070 wanhope is in two maneres
  the firste wanhope is in the mercy of crist
  
  1070a that oother is that they thynken that they ne myghte nat longe persevere in goodnesse
  
   the firste wanhope comth of that he demeth that he hath synned so greetly and so ofte
  
   and so longe leyn in synne
  that he shal nat be saved
  
   certes
  agayns that cursed wanhope sholde he thynke that 
   the passion of jhesu crist is moore strong for to unbynde than synne is strong for to bynde
  
   agayns the seconde wanhope he shal thynke that as ofte as he falleth he may arise agayn by penitence
  
   and though he never so longe have leyn in synne
  the mercy of crist is alwey redy to receiven hym to mercy
  
   agayns the wanhope that he demeth that he sholde nat longe persevere in goodnesse
  
   he shal thynke that the feblesse of the devel may nothyng doon
  but if men wol suffren hym
  
   and eek he shal han strengthe of the help of god
  
   and of al hooly chirche
  and of the proteccioun of aungels
  if hym list
  
   thanne shal men understonde what is the fruyt of penaunce
  and
  after the word of jhesu crist
  
   it is the endelees blisse of hevene
  
   ther joye hath no contrarioustee of wo ne grevaunce
  ther alle harmes been passed of this present lyf
  
   ther as is the sikernesse fro the peyne of helle
  ther as is the blisful compaignye 
   that rejoysen hem everemo
  everich of otheres joye
  
   ther as the body of man
  that whilom was foul and derk
  is moore cleer than the sonne
  
   ther as the body
  that whilom was syk
  freele
  and fieble
  and mortal
  is inmortal
  
   and so strong and so hool that ther may no thyng apeyren it
  
   ther as ne is neither hunger
  thurst
  ne coold
  but every soule replenyssed with the sighte of the parfit knowynge of god
  
  1080 this blisful regne may men purchace by poverte espiritueel
  and the glorie by lowenesse
  the plentee of joye 
  1080a by hunger and thurst
  and the reste by travaille
  and the lyf by deeth and mortificacion of synne
  
   now preye i to hem alle that herkne this litel tretys or rede
  
   that if ther be any thyng in it that liketh hem
  
   that therof they thanken oure lord jhesu crist
  of whom procedeth al wit and al goodnesse
  
   and if ther be any thyng that displese hem
  i preye hem also that they arrette it to the defaute 
   of myn unkonnynge and nat to my wyl
  that wolde ful fayn have seyd bettre if i hadde had konnynge
  
   for oure book seith
  
 al that is writen is writen for oure doctrine
 
  
   and that is myn entente
  
   wherfore i biseke yow mekely
  for the mercy of god
  
   that ye preye for me that crist have mercy on me and foryeve me my giltes
  
   and namely of my translacions and enditynges of worldly vanitees
  the whiche i revoke in my retracciouns
  
   as is the book of troilus
  the book also of fame
  
   the book of the xxv
  ladies
  the book of the duchesse
  
   the book of seint valentynes day of the parlement of briddes
  the tales of caunterbury
  thilke that sownen into synne
  
   the book of the leoun
  and many another book
  if they were in my remembrance
  and many a song 
   and many a leccherous lay
  that crist for his grete mercy foryeve me the synne
  
   but of the translacion of boece de consolacione
  and othere bookes of legendes of seintes
  and omelies
  and moralitee
  and devocioun
  
   that thanke i oure lord jhesu crist and his blisful mooder
  and alle the seintes of hevene
  
  1090 bisekynge hem that they from hennes forth unto my lyves ende sende me grace to biwayle my giltes and to studie 
  1090a to the salvacioun of my soule
  and graunte me grace of verray penitence
  confessioun and satisfaccioun to doon in this present lyf
  
   thurgh the benigne grace of hym that is kyng of kynges and preest over alle preestes
  
   that boghte us with the precious blood of his herte
  
   so that i may been oon of hem at the day of doom that shulle be saved
  
   qui cum patre et spiritu sancto vivit et regnat deus per omnia secula
  amen
