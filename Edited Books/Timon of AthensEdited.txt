  to see so many dip there meate in one mans blood
  and 
  all the madnesse is
  he cheeres them vp too
  
  i wonder men dare trust themselues with men
  
  me thinks they should enuite them without kniues
  
  good for there meate
  and safer for their liues
  
  there s much example for t
  the fellow that sits next him
  
  now parts bread with him
  pledges the breath of him in 
  a diuided draught
  is the readiest man to kill him
   tas 
  beene proued
  if i were a huge man i should feare to 
  drinke at meales
  least they should spie my wind pipes 
  dangerous noates
  great men should drinke with harnesse 
  on their throates

  it pleases time and fortune to lye heauie 
  vpon a friend of mine
  who in hot blood 
  hath stept into the law
  which is past depth 
  to those that  without heede  do plundge intoo t
  
  he is a man  setting his fate aside  of comely vertues
  
  nor did he soyle the fact with cowardice
  
   and honour in him
  which buyes out his fault  
  but with a noble fury
  and faire spirit
  
  seeing his reputation touch d to death
  
  he did oppose his foe
  
  and with such sober and vnnoted passion 
  he did behooue his anger ere  twas spent
  
  as if he had but prou d an argument

  you vndergo too strict a paradox
  
  striuing to make an vgly deed looke faire
  
  your words haue tooke such paines
  as if they labour d 
  to bring man slaughter into forme
  and set quarrelling 
  vpon the head of valour
  which indeede 
  is valour mis begot
  and came into the world
  
  when sects
  and factions were newly borne
  
  hee s truly valiant
  that can wisely suffer 
  the worst that man can breath
  
  and make his wrongs
  his out sides
  
  to weare them like his rayment
  carelessely
  
  and ne re preferre his iniuries to his heart
  
  to bring it into danger
  
  if wrongs be euilles
  and inforce vs kill
  
  what folly  tis
  to hazard life for ill

  you cannot make grosse sinnes looke cleare
  
  to reuenge is no valour
  but to beare

  my lords
  then vnder fauour
  pardon me
  
  if i speake like a captaine
  
  why do fond men expose themselues to battell
  
  and not endure all threats
  sleepe vpon t
  
  and let the foes quietly cut their throats 
  without repugnancy
  if there be 
  such valour in the bearing
  what make wee 
  abroad
  why then
  women are more valiant 
  that stay at home
  if bearing carry it
  
  and the asse
  more captaine then the lyon
  
  the fellow loaden with irons
  wiser then the iudge
  
  if wisedome be in suffering
  oh my lords
  
  as you are great
  be pittifully good
  
  who cannot condemne rashnesse in cold blood
  
  to kill
  i grant
  is sinnes extreamest gust
  
  but in defence
  by mercy
   tis most iust
  
  to be in anger
  is impietie

  the deede of saying is quite out of vse

  and curse thy fill
  but passe and stay not here thy gate

  though thou abhorrd st in vs our humane griefes
  
  scornd st our braines flow
  and those our droplets
  which 
  from niggard nature fall
  yet rich conceit 
  taught thee to make vast neptune weepe for aye 
  on thy low graue
  on faults forgiuen
  dead 
  is noble timon
  of whose memorie 
  heereafter more
  bring me into your citie
  
  and i will vse the oliue
  with my sword
  
  make war breed peace
  make peace stint war
  make each 
  prescribe to other
  as each others leach
