  so shaken as we are
  so wan with care
  
  find we a time for frighted peace to pant
  
  and breathe short winded accents of new broils 
  to be commenced in strands afar remote
  
  no more the thirsty entrance of this soil 
  shall daub her lips with her own children s blood
  
  no more shall trenching war channel her fields
  
  nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs 
  of hostile paces
   those opposed eyes
  
  which
  like the meteors of a troubled heaven
  
  all of one nature
  of one substance bred
  
  did lately meet in the intestine shock 
  and furious close of civil butchery
  
  shall now
  in mutual well beseeming ranks
  
  march all one way
  and be no more opposed 
  against acquaintance
  kindred
  and allies
  
  the edge of war
  like an ill sheathed knife
  
  no more shall cut his master
  therefore
  friends
  
  as far as to the sepulchre of christ   
  whose soldier now
  under whose blessed cross 
  we are impressed and engaged to fight   
  forthwith a power of english shall we levy
  
  to chase these pagans in those holy fields 
  over whose acres walk d those blessed feet 
  which fourteen hundred years ago were nail d 
  for our advantage on the bitter cross
  
  but this our purpose now is twelvemonth old
  
  and bootless  tis to tell you we will go
  
  therefore we meet not now
   then let me hear 
  of you
  my gentle cousin westmoreland
  
  what yesternight our council did decree 
  in forwarding this dear expedience
  
   
  west
  
  my liege
  this haste was hot in question
  
  and many limits of the charge set down 
  but yesternight
  when
  all athwart
  there came 
  a post from wales loaden with heavy news
  
  whose worst was
  that the noble mortimer
  
  leading the men of herefordshire to fight 
  against th  irregular and wild glendower
  
  was by the rude hands of that welshman taken
  
  a thousand of his people butchered
  
  upon whose dead corpse  there was such misuse
  
  such beastly
  shameless transformation
  
  by those welshwomen done
  as may not be 
  without much shame re told or spoken of
  
   
  king
  
  it seems
  then
  that the tidings of this broil 
  brake off our business for the holy land
  
   
  west
  
  this
  match d with other
  did
  my gracious lord
  
  for more uneven and unwelcome news 
  came from the north
  and thus it did import
  
  on holy rood day the gallant hotspur there
  
  young harry percy
  and brave archibald
  
  that ever valiant and approved scot
  
  at holmedon met
  
  where they did spend a sad and bloody hour
  
  as by discharge of their artillery
  
  and shape of likelihood
  the news was told
  
  for he that brought them
  in the very heat 
  and pride of their contention did take horse
  
  uncertain of the issue any way
  
   
  king
  
  here is a dear and true industrious friend
  
  sir walter blunt
  new lighted from his horse
  
  stain d with the variation of each soil 
  betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours
  
  and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news
  
  the earl of douglas is discomfited
  
  ten thousand bold scots
  two and twenty knights
  
  balk d in their own blood
  did sir walter see 
  on holmedon s plains
   of prisoners
  hotspur took 
  mordake the earl of fife and eldest son 
  to beaten douglas
  and the earls of athol
  
  of murray
  angus
  and menteith
  
  and is not this an honourable spoil
  
  a gallant prize
  ha
  cousin
  is it not
  
   
  west
  
  faith
   tis a conquest for a prince to boast of
  
   
  king
  
  yea
  there thou makest me sad
  and makest me sin 
  in envy that my lord northumberland 
  should be the father to so blest a son
    
  a son who is the theme of honour s tongue
  
  amongst a grove
  the very straightest plant
  
  who is sweet fortune s minion and her pride
  
  whilst i
  by looking on the praise of him
  
  see riot and dishonour stain the brow 
  of my young harry
  o
  that it could be proved 
  that some night tripping fairy had exchanged 
  in cradle clothes our children where they lay
  
  and call d mine percy
  his plantagenet
  
  then would i have his harry
  and he mine
  
  but let him from my thoughts
  what think you
  coz
  
  of this young percy s pride
  the prisoners
  
  which he in this adventure hath surprised
  
  to his own use he keeps
  and sends me word
  
  i shall have none but mordake earl of fife
  
   
  west
  
  this is his uncle s teaching
  this is worcester
  
  malevolent to you in all aspects
  
  which makes him prune himself
  and bristle up 
  the crest of youth against your dignity
  
   
  king
  
  but i have sent for him to answer this
  
  and for this cause awhile we must neglect 
  our holy purpose to jerusalem
  
  cousin
  on wednesday next our council we 
  will hold at windsor
  so inform the lords
  
  but come yourself with speed to us again
  
  for more is to be said and to be done 
  than out of anger can be uttered
  
   
  west
  
  i will
  my liege
  
   
   
   exeunt

  now
  hal
  what time of day is it
  lad
  
   
  prince
  
  thou art so fat witted
  with drinking of old sack
  and 
  unbuttoning thee after supper
  and sleeping upon benches 
  after noon
  that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which 
  thou wouldst truly know
  what a devil hast thou to do with the 
  time of the day
  unless hours were cups of sack
  and minutes 
  capons
  and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in 
  flame coloured taffeta
  i see no reason why thou shouldst be 
  so superfluous to demand the time of the day
  
   
  fal
  
  indeed
  you come near me now
  hal
  for we that take purses go 
  by the moon and the seven stars
  and not by phoebus
   he
  that 
  wandering knight so fair
  and i pr ythee
  sweet wag
  when thou 
  art king
   as
  god save thy grace  majesty i should say
  for 
  grace 
  thou wilt have none
    
   
  prince
  
  what
  none
  
   
  fal
  
  no
  by my troth
  not so much as will serve to be prologue 
  to an egg and butter
  
   
  prince
  
  well
  how then

  roundly
  roundly
  
   
  fal
  
  marry
  then
  sweet wag
  when thou art king
  let not us that 
  are squires of the night s body be called thieves of the day s 
  beauty
   let us be diana s foresters
  gentlemen of the shade
  
  minions of the moon
  and let men say we be men of good 
  government
  being governed
  as the sea is
  by our noble and 
  chaste mistress the moon
  under whose countenance we steal
  
   
   
  prince
  
  thou say st well
  and it holds well too
  for the fortune of 
  us that are the moon s men doth ebb and flow like the sea
  
  being governed
  as the sea is
  by the moon
  as
  for proof
  now
  a 
  purse of gold most resolutely snatch d on monday night
  and most 
  dissolutely spent on tuesday morning
  got with swearing lay by
  
  and spent with crying bring in
  now ill as low an ebb as the foot 
  of the ladder
  and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the 
  gallows
  
   
  fal
  
  by the lord
  thou say st true
  lad
   and is not my hostess of the 
  tavern a most sweet wench
  
   
  prince
  
  as the honey of hybla
  my old lad of the castle
   and is not a 
  buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance
  
   
  fal
  
  how now
  how now
  mad wag
  what
  in thy quips and thy 
  quiddities
  what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin
  
   
  prince
  
  why
  what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern
  
   
  fal
  
  well
  thou hast call d her to a reckoning many a time and oft
  
   
  prince
  
  did i ever call for thee to pay thy part
  
   
  fal
  
  no
  i ll give thee thy due
  thou hast paid all there
  
   
  prince
  
  yea
  and elsewhere
  so far as my coin would stretch
  
  and where it would not
  i have used my credit
  
   
  fal
  
  yea
  and so used it
  that
  were it not here apparent that 
  thou art heir apparent  but i pr ythee
  sweet wag
  shall there be 
  gallows standing in england when thou art king
  and 
  resolution thus fobb d as it is with the rusty curb of old father 
  antic the law
  do not thou
  when thou art king
  hang a thief
  
   
  prince
  
  no
  thou shalt
  
   
  fal

  prince
  
  thou judgest false already
   i mean
  thou shalt have the 
  hanging of the thieves
  and so become a rare hangman
  
   
  fal
  
  well
  hal
  well
  and in some sort it jumps with my humour
  
  as well as waiting in the court
  i can tell you
  
   
  prince
  
  for obtaining of suits
  
   
  fal
  
  yea
  for obtaining of suits
  whereof the hangman hath no 
  lean wardrobe
   sblood
  i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a 
  lugg d bear
  
   
  prince
  
  or an old lion
  or a lover s lute
  
   
  fal
  
  yea
  or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe
  
   
  prince
  
  what say st thou to a hare
  or the melancholy of moor ditch
  
   
  fal
  
  thou hast the most unsavoury similes
  and art
  indeed
  the 
  most comparative
  rascalliest
  sweet young prince
   but
  hal
  i 
  pr ythee trouble me no more with vanity
  i would to god thou and 
  i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought
  an old 
  lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you
  
  sir
   but i mark d him not
  and yet he talk d very wisely
   but i 
  regarded him not
  and yet he talk d wisely
  and in the street too
  
   
  prince
  
  thou didst well
  for wisdom cries out in the streets
  and no man 
  regards it
  
   
  fal
  
  o
  thou hast damnable iteration
  and art
  indeed
  able to corrupt 
  a saint
  
  thou hast done much harm upon me
  hal
  god forgive thee for it
  
  before i knew thee
  hal
  i knew nothing
  and now am i
  if a man 
  should speak truly
  little better than one of the wicked
  i must 
  give over this life
  and i will give it over
  by the lord
  an i do 
  not
  i am a villain
   i ll be damn d for never a king s son in 
  christendom
  
   
  prince
  
  where shall we take a purse to morrow
  jack
  
   
  fal
  
  zounds
  where thou wilt
  lad
  i ll make one
   an i do not
  call 
  me villain
  and baffle me
  
   
  prince
  
  i see a good amendment of life in thee
   from praying to 
  purse taking
  
   
  fal
  
  why
  hal
   tis my vocation
  hal
   tis no sin for a man to labour 
  in his vocation

   now shall we know if gadshill have set a match
  o
  if 
  men were to be saved by merit

  for a cup of madeira and a cold capon s leg
  
   
  prince

  for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs
   he will give the 
  devil his due

  then art thou damn d for keeping thy word with the devil
  
   
  prince
  
  else he had been damn d for cozening the devil

  but
  my lads
  my lads

  you have horses for 
  yourselves
   gadshill lies to night in rochester
   i have bespoke 
  supper to morrow night in eastcheap

  by my faith
  
   
  fal
  
  there s neither honesty
  manhood
  nor good fellowship in thee
  
  nor thou camest not of the blood royal
  if thou darest not stand 
  for ten shillings
  
   
  prince
  
  well

  sir john
  i pr ythee
  leave the prince and me alone
  i will 
  lay him down such reasons for this adventure
  that he shall go
  
   
  fal
  
  well
  god give thee the spirit of persuasion
  and him the ears 
  of profiting
  that what thou speakest may move
  and what he 
  hears may be believed
  that the true prince may
  for recreation  
  sake
  prove a false thief
  for the poor abuses of the time want 
  countenance
  farewell
  you shall find me in eastcheap
  
   
  prince
  
  farewell
  thou latter spring
  farewell
  all hallown summer
  
   
   exit falstaff
   
   
  pointz
  
  now
  my good sweet honey lord
  ride with us to morrow
   i 
  have a jest to execute that i cannot manage alone
  falstaff
  
  bardolph
  peto
  and gadshill
  shall rob those men that we have 
  already waylaid
   yourself and i will not be there
  and when they 
  have the booty
  if you and i do not rob them
  cut this head off 
  from my shoulders
  
   
  prince
  
  but how shall we part with them in setting forth
  
   
  pointz
  
  why
  we will set forth before or after them
  and appoint them 
  a place of meeting
  wherein it is at our pleasure to fail
  and 
  then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves
  which they 
  shall have no sooner achieved but we ll set upon them
  
   
  prince
  
  ay
  but  tis like that they will know us by our horses
  by our 
  habits
  and by every other appointment
  to be ourselves
  
   
  pointz
  
  tut
  our horses they shall not see
   i ll tie them in the wood
  
  our visards we will change
  after we leave them
  and
  sirrah
  i 
  have cases of buckram for the nonce
  to immask our noted 
  outward garments
  
   
  prince
  
  but i doubt they will be too hard for us
  
   
  pointz
  
  well
  for two of them
  i know them to be as true bred 
  cowards as ever turn d back
  and for the third
  if he fight 
  longer than he sees reason
  i ll forswear arms
  the virtue of 
  this jest will be
  the incomprehensible lies that this same fat 
  rogue will tell us when we meet at supper
  how thirty
  at least
  
  he fought with
  what wards
  what blows
  what extremities he 
  endured
  and in the reproof of this lies the jest
  
   
  prince
  
  well
  i ll go with thee
   provide us all things necessary and 
  meet me to night in eastcheap
  there i ll sup
  farewell
  
   
  pointz
  
  farewell
  my lord
  
   
   exit
   
   
  prince
  
  i know you all
  and will awhile uphold 
  the unyok d humour of your idleness
  
  yet herein will i imitate the sun
  
  who doth permit the base contagious clouds 
  to smother up his beauty from the world
  
  that
  when he please again to be himself
  
  being wanted
  he may be more wonder d at
  
  by breaking through the foul and ugly mists 
  of vapours that did seem to strangle him
  
  if all the year were playing holidays
  
  to sport would be as tedious as to work
  
  but
  when they seldom come
  they wish d for come
  
  and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents
  
  so
  when this loose behaviour i throw off
  
  and pay the debt i never promised
  
  by how much better than my word i am
  
  by so much shall i falsify men s hopes
  
  and
  like bright metal on a sullen ground
  
  my reformation
  glittering o er my fault
  
  shall show more goodly and attract more eyes 
  than that which hath no foil to set it off
  
  i ll so offend
  to make offence a skill
  
  redeeming time
  when men think least i will
  
   
   exit

  sir walter 
  blunt
  and others

  my blood hath been too cold and temperate
  
  unapt to stir at these indignities
  
  and you have found me
  for
  accordingly
  
  you tread upon my patience
   but be sure 
  i will from henceforth rather be myself
  
  mighty and to be fear d
  than my condition
  
  which hath been smooth as oil
  soft as young down
  
  and therefore lost that title of respect 
  which the proud soul ne er pays but to the proud
  
   
  wor
  
  our house
  my sovereign liege
  little deserves 
  the scourge of greatness to be used on it
  
  and that same greatness too which our own hands 
  have holp to make so portly
  
   
  north
  
  my good lord
    
   
  king
  
  worcester
  get thee gone
  for i do see 
  danger and disobedience in thine eye
  
  o
  sir
  your presence is too bold and peremptory
  
  and majesty might never yet endure 
  the moody frontier of a servant brow
  
  you have good leave to leave us
   when we need 
  your use and counsel
  we shall send for you
  
   
   exit worcester
   
   
   to northumberland
   
   
  you were about to speak
  
   
  north
  
  yea
  my good lord
  
  those prisoners in your highness  name demanded
  
  which harry percy here at holmedon took
  
  were
  as he says
  not with such strength denied 
  as is deliver d to your majesty
  
  either envy
  therefore
  or misprision 
  is guilty of this fault
  and not my son
  
   
  hot
  
  my liege
  i did deny no prisoners
  
  but
  i remember
  when the fight was done
  
  when i was dry with rage and extreme toil
  
  breathless and faint
  leaning upon my sword
  
  came there a certain lord
  neat
  trimly dress d
  
  fresh as a bridegroom
  and his chin new reap d 
  show d like a stubble land at harvest home
  
  he was perfumed like a milliner
  
  and  twixt his finger and his thumb he held 
  a pouncet box
  which ever and anon 
  he gave his nose
  and took t away again
  
  who therewith angry
  when it next came there
  
  took it in snuff
   and still he smiled and talk d
  
  and
  as the soldiers bore dead bodies by
  
  he call d them untaught knaves
  unmannerly
  
  to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse 
  betwixt the wind and his nobility
  
  with many holiday and lady terms 
  he question d me
  amongst the rest
  demanded 
  my prisoners in your majesty s behalf
  
  i then
  all smarting with my wounds being cold
  
  out of my grief and my impatience 
  to be so pester d with a popinjay
  
  answer d neglectingly
  i know not what
    
  he should
  or he should not
  for t made me mad 
  to see him shine so brisk
  and smell so sweet
  
  and talk so like a waiting gentlewoman 
  of guns and drums and wounds
   god save the mark
    
  and telling me the sovereign st thing on earth 
  was parmaceti for an inward bruise
  
  and that it was great pity
  so it was
  
  this villainous salt petre should be digg d 
  out of the bowels of the harmless earth
  
  which many a good tall fellow had destroy d 
  so cowardly
  and
  but for these vile guns
  
  he would himself have been a soldier
  
  this bald unjointed chat of his
  my lord
  
  i answered indirectly
  as i said
  
  and i beseech you
  let not his report 
  come current for an accusation 
  betwixt my love and your high majesty
  
   
  blunt
  
  the circumstance consider d
  good my lord
  
  whatever harry percy then had said 
  to such a person
  and in such a place
  
  at such a time
  with all the rest re told
  
  may reasonably die
  and never rise 
  to do him wrong
  or any way impeach 
  what then he said
  so he unsay it now
  
   
  king
  
  why
  yet he doth deny his prisoners
  
  but with proviso and exception
  
  that we at our own charge shall ransom straight 
  his brother in law
  the foolish mortimer
  
  who
  on my soul
  hath wilfully betray d 
  the lives of those that he did lead to fight 
  against that great magician
  damn d glendower
  
  whose daughter
  as we hear
  the earl of march 
  hath lately married
  shall our coffers
  then
  
  be emptied to redeem a traitor home
  
  shall we buy treason
  and indent with fears 
  when they have lost and forfeited themselves
  
  no
  on the barren mountains let him starve
  
  for i shall never hold that man my friend 
  whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost 
  to ransom home revolted mortimer
  
   
  hot
  
  revolted mortimer
  
  he never did fall off
  my sovereign liege
  
  but by the chance of war
   to prove that true 
  needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds
  
  those mouthed wounds
  which valiantly he took
  
  when on the gentle severn s sedgy bank
  
  in single opposition
  hand to hand
  
  he did confound the best part of an hour 
  in changing hardiment with great glendower
  
  three times they breathed
  and three times did they drink
  
  upon agreement
  of swift severn s flood
  
  who then
  affrighted with their bloody looks
  
  ran fearfully among the trembling reeds
  
  and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank 
  blood stained with these valiant combatants
  
  never did base and rotten policy 
  colour her working with such deadly wounds
  
  nor never could the noble mortimer 
  receive so many
  and all willingly
  
  then let not him be slander d with revolt
  
   
  king
  
  thou dost belie him
  percy
  thou dost belie him
  
  he never did encounter with glendower
  
  i tell thee
  
  he durst as well have met the devil alone 
  as owen glendower for an enemy
  
  art not ashamed
  but
  sirrah
  henceforth 
  let me not hear you speak of mortimer
  
  send me your prisoners with the speediest means
  
  or you shall hear in such a kind from me 
  as will displease you
   my lord northumberland
  
  we license your departure with your son
    
  send us your prisoners
  or you ll hear of it

  whose wrongs in us god pardon
   did set forth 
  upon his irish expedition
  
  from whence he intercepted did return 
  to be deposed
  and shortly murdered

  upon the head of this forgetful man
  
  and for his sake wear the detested blot 
  of murderous subornation
   shall it be
  
  that you a world of curses undergo
  
  being the agents
  or base second means
  
  the cords
  the ladder
  or the hangman rather
    
  o
  pardon me
  that i descend so low
  
  to show the line and the predicament 
  wherein you range under this subtle king
    
  shall it
  for shame
  be spoken in these days
  
  or fill up chronicles in time to come
  
  that men of your nobility and power 
  did gage them both in an unjust behalf
    
  as both of you
  god pardon it
  have done
    
  to put down richard
  that sweet lovely rose
  
  and plant this thorn
  this canker
  bolingbroke
  
  and shall it
  in more shame
  be further spoken
  
  that you are fool d
  discarded
  and shook off 
  by him for whom these shames ye underwent
  
  no
  yet time serves
  wherein you may redeem 
  your banish d honours
  and restore yourselves 
  into the good thoughts of the world again
  
  revenge the jeering and disdain d contempt 
  of this proud king
  who studies day and night 
  to answer all the debt he owes to you 
  even with the bloody payment of your deaths
  
  therefore
  i say
    
   
  wor
  
  peace

  as to o er walk a current roaring loud 
  on the unsteadfast footing of a spear

  if we fall in
  good night
  or sink or swim
  
  send danger from the east unto the west
  
  so honour cross it from the north to south
  
  and let them grapple

  the blood more stirs 
  to rouse a lion than to start a hare
  
   
  north
  
  imagination of some great exploit 
  drives him beyond the bounds of patience
  
   
  hot
  
  by heaven
  methinks it were an easy leap
  
  to pluck bright honour from the pale faced moon
  
  or dive into the bottom of the deep
  
  where fathom line could never touch the ground
  
  and pluck up drowned honour by the locks
  
  so he that doth redeem her thence might wear 
  without corrival all her dignities
  
  but out upon this half faced fellowship
  
   
  wor
  
  he apprehends a world of figures here
  
  but not the form of what he should attend

  danger
  we pluck this flower
  safety
  the purpose you undertake is 
  dangerous
  the friends you have named uncertain

  great an opposition

  of basilisks
  of cannon
  culverin
  
  of prisoners ransomed
  and of soldiers slain
  
  and all the  currents of a heady fight
  
  thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
  
  and thus hath so bestirr d thee in thy sleep
  
  that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
  
  like bubbles in a late disturbed stream
  
  and in thy face strange motions have appear d
  
  such as we see when men restrain their breath

  the more it is trodden on
  
  the faster it grows
  yet youth
  the more it is wasted
  the sooner 
  it wears
  that thou art my son
  i have partly thy mother s word
  
  partly my own opinion
  but chiefly a villainous trick of thine eye
  
  and a foolish hanging of thy nether lip
  that doth warrant me
  if
  
  then
  thou be son to me
  here lies the point
   why
  being son to me
  
  art thou so pointed at
  
  shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher
  and eat blackberries
  
  a question not to be ask d
  shall the son of england prove a thief
  
  and take purses
  a question to be ask d
  
  there is a thing
  harry
  which thou hast often heard of
  and it is 
  known to many in our land by the name of pitch
   this pitch
  as 
  ancient writers do report
  doth defile
  so doth the company thou 
  keepest
   for
  harry
  now i do not speak to thee in drink
  but in 
  tears
  not in pleasure
  but in passion
  not in words only
  
  but in woes also
   and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have 
  often noted in thy company
  but i know not his name
  
   
  prince
  
  what manner of man
  an it like your majesty
  
   
  fal
  
  a goodly portly man
  i faith
  and a corpulent
  of a cheerful look
  
  a pleasing eye
  and a most noble carriage
  and
  as i think
  his age 
  some fifty
  or
  by r lady
  inclining to threescore
  and now i 
  remember me
  his name is falstaff
   if that man should be lewdly given
  
  he deceiveth me
  for
  harry
  i see virtue in his looks
  
  if
  then
  the tree may be known by the fruit
  as the fruit by the tree
  
  then
  peremptorily i speak it
  there is virtue in that falstaff
   him 
  keep with
  the rest banish
  and tell me now
  thou naughty varlet
  tell 
  me where hast thou been this month

  so majestically

  poulter s hare

  ungracious boy
  henceforth ne er look on me
  thou art 
  violently carried away from grace
   there is a devil haunts thee
  in 
  the likeness of an old fat man
   a tun of man is thy companion
  why 
  dost thou converse with that trunk of humours
  that bolting hutch of 
  beastliness
  that swollen parcel of dropsies
  that huge bombard of 
  sack
  that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly
  that 
  reverend vice
  that grey iniquity
  that father ruffian
  that vanity 
  in years
  wherein is he good
  but to taste sack and drink it
  wherein 
  neat and cleanly
  but to carve a capon and eat it
  wherein cunning
  but 
  in craft
  wherein crafty
  but in villany
  wherein villainous
  but in 
  all things
  wherein worthy
  but in nothing

  i would your grace would take me with you
   whom means your grace

  i know thou dost
  
   
  fal
  
  but to say i know more harm in him than in myself
  were to say more 
  than i know
  that he is old
    the more the pity
   his white hairs do 
  witness it
  if sack and sugar be a fault
  god help the wicked
  if to 
  be old and merry be a sin
  then many an old host that i know is damn d
  
  if to be fat be to be hated
  then pharaoh s lean kine are to be loved
  
  no

   banish peto
  banish bardolph

  diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth 
  in strange eruptions
  oft the teeming earth 
  is with a kind of colic pinch d and vex d 
  by the imprisoning of unruly wind 
  within her womb
  which
  for enlargement striving
  
  shakes the old beldam earth

  steeples and moss grown towers

  our grandam earth
  having this distemperature
  
  in passion shook

  were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields

  with telling me of the moldwarp and the ant
  
  of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies
  
  and of a dragon and a finless fish
  
  a clip wing d griffin and a moulten raven
  
  a couching lion and a ramping cat
  
  and such a deal of skimble skamble stuff 
  as puts me from my faith
  i tell you what
  
  he held me last night at the least nine hours 
  in reckoning up the several devils  names 
  that were his lacqueys
   i cried hum
  and well
  
  but mark d him not a word
  o
  he s as tedious 
  as a tired horse
  a railing wife
  
  worse than a smoky house

  with cheese and garlic in a windmill
  far
  
  than feed on cates and have him talk to me

  valiant as a lion

  as mines of india
  shall i tell you
  cousin
  
  he holds your temper in a high respect
  
  and curbs himself even of his natural scope 
  when you do cross his humour
  faith
  he does
  
  i warrant you
  that man is not alive 
  might so have tempted him as you have done
  
  without the taste of danger and reproof
  
  but do not use it oft
  let me entreat you
  
   
   
  wor
  
  in faith
  my lord
  you are too wilful blunt
  
  and since your coming hither have done enough 
  to put him quite beside his patience
  
  you must needs learn
  lord
  to amend this fault
  
  though sometimes it show greatness
  courage
  blood   
  and that s the dearest grace it renders you
    
  yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage
  
  defect of manners
  want of government
  
  pride
  haughtiness
  opinion
  and disdain
  
  the least of which haunting a nobleman 
  loseth men s hearts
  and leaves behind a stain 
  upon the beauty of all parts besides
  
  beguiling them of commendation

  for some displeasing service i have done
  
  that
  in his secret doom
  out of my blood 
  he ll breed revengement and a scourge for me
  
  but thou dost
  in thy passages of life
  
  make me believe that thou art only mark d 
  for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven 
  to punish my mistreadings
  tell me else
  
  could such inordinate and low desires
  
  such poor
  such base
  such lewd
  such mean attempts
  
  such barren pleasures
  rude society
  
  as thou art match d withal and grafted to
  
  accompany the greatness of thy blood
  
  and hold their level with thy princely heart
  
   
  prince
  
  so please your majesty
  i would i could 
  quit all offences with as clear excuse 
  as well as i am doubtless i can purge 
  myself of many i am charged withal
  
  yet such extenuation let me beg
  
  as
  in reproof of many tales devised 
  by smiling pick thanks and base news mongers
    
  which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear
    
  i may
  for some things true
  wherein my youth 
  hath faulty wander d and irregular
  
  find pardon on my true submission
  
   
  king
  
  god pardon thee
  yet let me wonder
  harry
  
  at thy affections
  which do hold a wing 
  quite from the flight of all thy ancestors
  
  thy place in council thou hast rudely lost
  
  which by thy younger brother is supplied
  
  and art almost an alien to the hearts 
  of all the court and princes of my blood
  
  the hope and expectation of thy time 
  is ruin d
  and the soul of every man 
  prophetically does forethink thy fall
  
  had i so lavish of my presence been
  
  so common hackney d in the eyes of men
  
  so stale and cheap to vulgar company
  
  opinion
  that did help me to the crown
  
  had still kept loyal to possession
  
  and left me in reputeless banishment
  
   
  a fellow of no mark nor likelihood
  
  by being seldom seen
  i could not stir 
  but
  like a comet
  i was wonder d at
  
  that men would tell their children
  this is he
  
  others would say
  where
  which is bolingbroke
  
  and then i stole all courtesy from heaven
  
  and dress d myself in such humility
  
  that i did pluck allegiance from men s hearts
  
  loud shouts and salutations from their mouths
  
  even in the presence of the crowned king
  
  thus did i keep my person fresh and new
  
  my presence
  like a robe pontifical
  
  ne er seen but wonder d at
   and so my state
  
  seldom but sumptuous
  showed like a feast
  
  and won by rareness such solemnity
  
  the skipping king
  he ambled up and down 
  with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits
  
  soon kindled and soon burnt
  carded his state
  
  mingled his royalty
  with capering fools
  
  had his great name profaned with their scorns
  
  and gave his countenance
  against his name
  
  to laugh at gibing boys
  and stand the push 
  of every beardless vain comparative
  
  grew a companion to the common streets
  
  enfeoff d himself to popularity
  
  that
  being dally swallow d by men s eyes
  
  they surfeited with honey
  and began 
  to loathe the taste of sweetness
  whereof a little 
  more than a little is by much too much
  
  so
  when he had occasion to be seen
  
  he was but as the cuckoo is in june
  
  heard
  not regarded
  seen
  but with such eyes 
  as
  sick and blunted with community
  
  afford no extraordinary gaze
  
  such as is bent on sun like majesty 
  when it shines seldom in admiring eyes
  
  but rather drowsed
  and hung their eyelids down
  
  slept in his face
  and render d such aspect 
  as cloudy men use to their adversaries
  
  being with his presence glutted
  gorged
  and full
  
  and in that very line
  harry
  stand st thou
  
  for thou hast lost thy princely privilege 
  with vile participation
   not an eye 
  but is a weary of thy common sight
  
  save mine
  which hath desired to see thee more
  
  which now doth that i would not have it do
  
  make blind itself with foolish tenderness
  
   
  prince
  
  i shall hereafter
  my thrice gracious lord
  
  be more myself

  was richard then 
  when i from france set foot at ravenspurg

  by my sceptre
  and my soul to boot
  
  he hath more worthy interest to the state 
  than thou
  the shadow of succession
  
  for
  of no right
  nor colour like to right
  
  he doth fill fields with harness in the realm
  
  turns head against the lion s armed jaws
  
  and
  being no more in debt to years than thou
  
  leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on 
  to bloody battles and to bruising arms
  
  what never dying honour hath he got 
  against renowned douglas
  whose high deeds
  
  whose hot incursions
  and great name in arms
  
  holds from all soldiers chief majority 
  and military title capital 
  through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ
  
  thrice hath this hotspur
  mars in swathing clothes
  
  this infant warrior
  in his enterprises 
  discomfited great douglas
  ta en him once
  
  enlarged him

   through vassal fear
  
  base inclination

  prince
  
  do not think so
  you shall not find it so
  
  and god forgive them that so much have sway d 
  your majesty s good thoughts away from me

  in the closing of some glorious day
  
  be bold to tell you that i am your son
  
  when i will wear a garment all of blood
  
  and stain my favour in a bloody mask
  
  which
  wash d away
  shall scour my shame with it

  this all praised knight

  chance to meet
  
  for every honour sitting on his helm
  
  would they were multitudes
  and on my head

  for the time will come
  
  that i shall make this northern youth exchange 
  his glorious deeds for my indignities
  
  percy is but my factor
  good my lord
  
  t  engross up glorious deeds on my behalf
  
  and i will call hall to so strict account
  
  that he shall render every glory up
  
  yea
  even the slightest worship of his time
  
  or i will tear the reckoning from his heart
  
  this
  in the name of god
  i promise here
  
  the which if i perform
  and do survive
  
  i do beseech your majesty
  may salve 
  the long grown wounds of my intemperance

  he cannot come
  my lord
  he s grievous sick

  zwounds
  how has he the leisure to be sick 
  in such a justling time
  who leads his power
  
  under whose government come they along

  doth he keep his bed

  he did
  my lord
  four days ere i set forth
  
  and at the time of my departure thence 
  he was much fear d by his physicians
  
   
  wor
  
  i would the state of time had first been whole 
  ere he by sickness had been visited
  
  his health was never better worth than now
  
   
  hot
  
  sick now
  droop now
  this sickness doth infect 
  the very life blood of our enterprise
  
   tis catching hither
  even to our camp
  
   
  he writes me here
  that inward sickness
    
  and that his friends by deputation could not 
  so soon be drawn
  no did he think it meet 
  to lay so dangerous and dear a trust 
  on any soul removed
  but on his own
  
  yet doth he give us bold advertisement
  
  that with our small conjunction we should on
  
  to see how fortune is disposed to us
  
  for
  as he writes
  there is no quailing now
  
  because the king is certainly possess d 
  of all our purposes
  what say you to it

  your father s sickness is a maim to us
  
   
  hot
  
  a perilous gash
  a very limb lopp d off
    
  and yet
  in faith
   tis not
  his present want 
  seems more than we shall find it
  were it good 
  to set the exact wealth of all our states 
  all at one cast
  to set so rich a main 
  on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour
  
  it were not good
  for therein should we read 
  the very bottom and the soul of hope
  
  the very list
  the very utmost bound 
  of all our fortunes
  
   
  doug
  
  faith
  and so we should
  
  where now remains a sweet reversion
  
  and we may boldly spend upon the hope 
  of what is to come in
  
  a comfort of retirement lives in this
  
   
  hot
  
  a rendezvous
  a home to fly unto
  
  if that the devil and mischance look big 
  upon the maidenhead of our affairs
  
   
  wor
  
  but yet i would your father had been here
  
  the quality and hair of our attempt 
  brooks no division
   it will be thought 
  by some
  that know not why he is away
  
  that wisdom
  loyalty
  and mere dislike 
  of our proceedings
  kept the earl from hence
  
  and think how such an apprehension 
  may turn the tide of fearful faction
  
  and breed a kind of question in our cause
  
  for well you know we of the offering side 
  must keep aloof from strict arbitrement
  
  and stop all sight holes
  every loop from whence 
  the eye of reason may pry in upon us
  
  this absence of your father s draws a curtain
  
  that shows the ignorant a kind of fear 
  before not dreamt of
  
   
  hot
  
  nay
  you strain too far
  
  i
  rather
  of his absence make this use
  
  it lends a lustre and more great opinion
  
  a larger dare to our great enterprise
  
  than if the earl were here
  for men must think
  
  if we
  without his help
  can make a head 
  to push against the kingdom
  with his help 
  we shall o erturn it topsy turvy down
  
  yet all goes well
  yet all our joints are whole

   there is not such a word 
  spoke in scotland as this term of fear

  yeomen s sons
  inquired 
  me out contracted bachelors
  such as had been ask d twice on the 
  banns
  such a commodity of warm slaves as had as lief hear the 
  devil as a drum
  such as fear the report of a caliver worse than 
  a struck fowl or a hurt wild duck
  i press d me none but such 
  toasts and butter
  with hearts in their bodies no bigger than 
  pins  heads

  and now 
  my whole charge consists of ancients
  corporals
  lieutenants
  
  gentlemen of companies
  slaves as ragged as lazarus in the 
  painted cloth

  such as
  indeed
  were never soldiers
  but discarded unjust 
  serving men
  younger sons to younger brothers
  revolted tapsters
  
  and ostlers trade fallen
  the cankers of a calm world and a long 
  peace
  ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced 
  ancient
   and such have i
  to fill up the rooms of them that have 
  bought out their services
  that you would think that i had a 
  hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from 
  swine keeping
  from eating draff and husks
  a mad fellow met me on 
  the way
  and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets
  and press d 
  the dead bodies

  i ll not march through coventry 
  with them

  indeed
  i had the most of 
  them out of prison
  there s but a shirt and a half in all my company
  
  and the half shirt is two napkins tack d together and thrown over the 
  shoulders like a herald s coat without sleeves
  and the shirt

  drag back our expedition
   certain horse 
  of my cousin vernon s are not yet come up
  
  your uncle worcester s horse came but to day
  
  and now their pride and mettle is asleep
  
  their courage with hard labour tame and dull
  
  that not a horse is half the half himself
  
   
  hot
  
  so are the horses of the enemy 
  in general
  journey bated and brought low
  
  the better part of ours are full of rest
  
   
  wor
  
  the number of the king exceedeth ours
  
  for god s sake
  cousin
  stay till all come in

  blunt
  
  i come with gracious offers from the king
  
  if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect
  
   
  hot
  
  welcome
  sir walter blunt
  and would to god 
  you were of our determination
  
  some of us love you well
  and even those some 
  envy your great deservings and good name
  
  because you are not of our quality
  
  but stand against us like an enemy
  
   
  blunt
  
  and god defend but still i should stand so
  
  so long as out of limit and true rule 
  you stand against anointed majesty
  
  but to my charge
   the king hath sent to know 
  the nature of your griefs
  and whereupon 
  you conjure from the breast of civil peace 
  such bold hostility
  teaching his duteous land 
  audacious cruelty
  if that the king 
  have any way your good deserts forgot
  
  which he confesseth to be manifold
  
  he bids you name your griefs
  and with all speed 
  you shall have your desires with interest
  
  and pardon absolute for yourself and these 
  herein misled by your suggestion
  
   
  hot
  
  the king is kind
  and well we know the king 
  knows at what time to promise
  when to pay
  
  my father and my uncle and myself 
  did give him that same royalty he wears
  
  and  when he was not six and twenty strong
  
  sick in the world s regard
  wretched and low
  
  a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home   
  my father gave him welcome to the shore
  
  and  when he heard him swear and vow to god
  
  he came but to be duke of lancaster
  
  to sue his livery and beg his peace
  
  with tears of innocence and terms of zeal   
  my father
  in kind heart and pity moved
  
  swore him assistance
  and performed it too
  
  now
  when the lords and barons of the realm 
  perceived northumberland did lean to him
  
  the more and less came in with cap and knee
  
  met him in boroughs
  cities
  villages
  
  attended him on bridges
  stood in lanes
  
  laid gifts before him
  proffer d him their oaths
  
  give him their heirs as pages
  follow d him 
  even at the heels in golden multitudes
  
  he presently  as greatness knows itself   
  steps me a little higher than his vow 
  made to my father
  while his blood was poor
  
  upon the naked shore at ravenspurg
  
  and now
  forsooth
  takes on him to reform 
  some certain edicts and some strait decrees 
  that lie too heavy on the commonwealth
  
  cries out upon abuses
  seems to weep 
  over his country s wrongs
  and
  by this face
  
  this seeming brow of justice
  did he win 
  the hearts of all that he did angle for
  
  proceeded further
  cut me off the heads 
  of all the favourites
  that the absent king 
  in deputation left behind him here 
  when he was personal in the irish war
  
   
  blunt
  
  tut
  i came not to hear this
  
   
  hot
  
  then to the point
  
  in short time after
  he deposed the king
  
  soon after that
  deprived him of his life
  
  and
  in the neck of that
  task d the whole state
  
  to make that worse
  suffer d his kinsman march 
   who is
  if every owner were well placed
  
  indeed his king  to be engaged in wales
  
  there without ransom to lie forfeited
  
  disgraced me in my happy victories
  
  sought to entrap me by intelligence
  
  rated my uncle from the council board
  
  in rage dismiss d my father from the court
  
  broke oath on oath
  committed wrong on wrong
  
  and
  in conclusion
  drove us to seek out 
  this head of safety
  and withal to pry 
  into his title
  the which now we find 
  too indirect for long continuance
  
   
   
  blunt
  
  shall i return this answer to the king
  
   
  hot
  
  not so
  sir walter
   we ll withdraw awhile
  
  go to the king
  and let there be impawn d 
  some surety for a safe return again
  
  and in the morning early shall my uncle 
  bring him our purposes
  and so
  farewell
  
   
  blunt
  
  i would you would accept of grace and love
  
   
  hot
  
  and may be so we shall

  good sir michael
  bear this sealed brief

  this to my cousin scroop
  and all the rest 
  to whom they are directed
  if you knew 
  how much they do import
  you would make haste
  
   
  sir m
  
  my good lord
  
  i guess their tenour

  like enough you do
  
  to morrow
  good sir michael
  is a day 
  wherein the fortune of ten thousand men 
  must bide the touch
  for
  sir
  at shrewsbury
  
  as i am truly given to understand
  
  the king
  with mighty and quick raised power
  
  meets with lord harry
   and
  i fear
  sir michael
  
  what with the sickness of northumberland
  
  whose power was in the first proportion
  
  and what with owen glendower s absence thence
  
  who with them was a rated sinew too
  
  and comes not in
  o er rul d by prophecies
    
  i fear the power of percy is too weak 
  to wage an instant trial with the king
  
   
  sir m
  
  why
  my good lord
  you need not fear
  
  there s douglas and lord mortimer
  
   
  arch
  
  no
  mortimer s not there
  
   
  sir m

  vernon
  lord harry percy
  
  and there s my lord of worcester
  and a head 
  of gallant warriors
  noble gentlemen

  and so there is
   but yet the king hath drawn 
  the special head of all the land together
  
  the prince of wales
  lord john of lancaster
  
  the noble westmoreland
  and warlike blunt
  
  and many more corrivals and dear men 
  of estimation and command in arms
  
   
  sir m
  
  doubt not
  my lord
  they shall be well opposed
  
   
  arch
  
  i hope no less
  yet needful  tis to fear
  
  and
  to prevent the worst
  sir michael
  speed
  
  for if lord percy thrive not
  ere the king 
  dismiss his power
  he means to visit us
  
  for he hath heard of our confederacy
  
  and  tis but wisdom to make strong against him
  
  therefore make haste
  i must go write again 
  to other friends

  how
  now
  my lord of worcester
   tis not well 
  that you and i should meet upon such terms 
  as now we meet
  you have deceived our trust
  
  and made us doff our easy robes of peace
  
  to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel
  
  this is not well
  my lord
  this is not well
  
  what say you to t
  will you again unknit 
  this churlish knot of all abhorred war
  
  and move in that obedient orb again 
  where you did give a fair and natural light
  
  and be no more an exhaled meteor
  
  a prodigy of fear
  and a portent 
  of broached mischief to the unborn times
  
   
  wor
  
  hear me
  my liege
  
  for mine own part
  i could be well content 
  to entertain the lag end of my life 
  with quiet hours
  for i do protest
  
  i have not sought the day of this dislike

  it pleased your majesty to turn your looks 
  of favour from myself and all our house
  
  and yet i must remember you
  my lord
  
  we were the first and dearest of your friends
  
  for you my staff of office did i break 
  in richard s time
  and posted day and night 
  to meet you on the way
  and kiss your hand
  
  when yet you were in place and in account 
  nothing so strong and fortunate as i
  
  it was myself
  my brother
  and his son
  
  that brought you home
  and boldly did outdare 
  the dangers of the time
  you swore to us
    
  and you did swear that oath at doncaster
    
  that you did nothing purpose  gainst the state
  
  nor claim no further than your new fall n right
  
  the seat of gaunt
  dukedom of lancaster
  
  to this we swore our aid
  but in short space 
  it rain d down fortune showering on your head
  
  and such a flood of greatness fell on you
    
  what with our help
  what with the absent king
  
  what with the injuries of a wanton time
  
  the seeming sufferances that you had borne
  
  and the contrarious winds that held the king 
  so long in his unlucky irish wars 
  that all in england did repute him dead
    
  and
  from this swarm of fair advantages
  
  you took occasion to be quickly woo d 
  to gripe the general sway into your hand
  
  forgot your oath to us at doncaster
  
  and
  being fed by us
  you used us so 
  as that ungentle gull
  the cuckoo bird
  
  useth the sparrow
  did oppress our nest
  
  grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
  
  that even our love thirst not come near your sight 
  for fear of swallowing
  but with nimble wing 
  we were enforced
  for safety sake
  to fly 
  out of your sight
  and raise this present head
  
  whereby we stand opposed by such means 
  as you yourself have forged against yourself
  
  by unkind usage
  dangerous countenance
  
  and violation of all faith and troth 
  sworn to tis in your younger enterprise
  
   
  king
  
  these things
  indeed
  you have articulate
  
  proclaim d at market crosses
  read in churches
  
  to face the garment of rebellion 
  with some fine colour that may please the eye 
  of fickle changelings and poor discontents
  
  which gape and rub the elbow at the news 
  of hurlyburly innovation
  
  and never yet did insurrection want 
  such water colours to impaint his cause
  
  nor moody beggars
  starving for a time 
  of pellmell havoc and confusion
  
   
  prince
  
  in both our armies there is many a soul 
  shall pay full dearly for this encounter
  
  if once they join in trial
  tell your nephew
  
  the prince of wales doth join with all the world 
  in praise of henry percy
   by my hopes
  
  this present enterprise set off his head
  
  i do not think a braver gentleman
  
  more active valiant or more valiant young
  
  more daring or more bold
  is now alive 
  to grace this latter age with noble deeds
  
  for my part
   i may speak it to my shame
    
  i have a truant been to chivalry
  
  and so i hear he doth account me too
  
  yet this before my father s majesty
    
  i am content that he shall take the odds 
  of his great name and estimation
  
  and will
  to save the blood on either side
  
  try fortune with him in a single fight

  shall be my friend again

  rebuke and dread correction wait on us

  when that this body did contain a spirit
  
  a kingdom for it was too small a bound
  
  but now two paces of the vilest earth 
  is room enough
  this earth that bears thee dead 
  bears not alive so stout a gentleman
  
  if thou wert sensible of courtesy
  
  i should not make so dear a show of zeal
  
  but let my favours hide thy mangled face
  
  and
  even in thy behalf
  i ll thank myself 
  for doing these fair rites of tenderness

  i am no counterfeit
   to die
  is to be a 
  counterfeit
  for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the 
  life of a man
   but to counterfeit dying
  when a man thereby liveth
  
  is to be no counterfeit
  but the true and perfect image of life indeed
  
  the better part of valour is discretion
  in the which better part i 
  have saved my life
    
  zwounds
  i am afraid of this gunpowder percy
  though he be dead
   how
  
  if he should counterfeit too
  and rise
  by my faith
  i am afraid he 
  would prove the better counterfeit
  therefore i ll make him sure
  yea
