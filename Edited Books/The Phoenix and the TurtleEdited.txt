the phoenix and the turtle 
   
   
   
   
  by william shakespeare 
   
   
   
   
   
   
  let the bird of loudest lay
  
  on the sole arabian tree
  
  herald sad and trumpet be
  
  to whose sound chaste wings obey
  
   
  but thou shrieking harbinger
  
  foul precurrer of the fiend
  
  augur of the fever s end
  
  to this troop come thou not near
  
   
  from this session interdict 
  every fowl of tyrant wing
  
  save the eagle
  feather d king
  
  keep the obsequy so strict
  
   
  let the priest in surplice white
  
  that defunctive music can
  
  be the death divining swan
  
  lest the requiem lack his right
  
   
  and thou treble dated crow
  
  that thy sable gender mak st 
  with the breath thou giv st and tak st
  
   mongst our mourners shalt thou go
  
   
  here the anthem doth commence
  
  love and constancy is dead
  
  phoenix and the turtle fled 
  in a mutual flame from hence
  
   
  so they lov d
  as love in twain 
  had the essence but in one
  
  two distincts
  division none
  
  number there in love was slain
  
   
  hearts remote
  yet not asunder
  
  distance and no space was seen 
   twixt this turtle and his queen
  
  but in them it were a wonder
  
   
  so between them love did shine
  
  that the turtle saw his right 
  flaming in the phoenix  sight
  
  either was the other s mine
  
   
  property was thus appalled
  
  that the self was not the same
  
  single nature s double name 
  neither two nor one was called
  
   
  reason
  in itself confounded
  
  saw division grow together
  
  to themselves yet either neither
  
  simple were so well compounded
  
   
  that it cried
  how true a twain 
  seemeth this concordant one
  
  love hath reason
  reason none
  
  if what parts can so remain
  
   
  whereupon it made this threne 
  to the phoenix and the dove
  
  co supremes and stars of love
  
  as chorus to their tragic scene
  
   
   
         threnos 
   
  beauty
  truth
  and rarity
  
  grace in all simplicity
  
  here enclos d in cinders lie
  
   
  death is now the phoenix  nest
  
  and the turtle s loyal breast 
  to eternity doth rest
  
   
  leaving no posterity
 
  
   twas not their infirmity
  
  it was married chastity
  
   
  truth may seem
  but cannot be
  
  beauty brag
  but  tis not she
  
  truth and beauty buried be
  
   
  to this urn let those repair 
  that are either true or fair
  
  for these dead birds sigh a prayer
