  author s preface 
   
  the prevailing taste of the public for anecdote has been censured and 
  ridiculed by critics who aspire to the character of superior wisdom
  
  but if we consider it in a proper point of view
  this taste is an 
  incontestable proof of the good sense and profoundly philosophic temper 
  of the present times
  of the numbers who study
  or at least who read 
  history
  how few derive any advantage from their labours
  the heroes of 
  history are so decked out by the fine fancy of the professed historian
  
  they talk in such measured prose
  and act from such sublime or such 
  diabolical motives
  that few have sufficient taste
  wickedness
  or 
  heroism
  to sympathise in their fate
  besides
  there is much uncertainty 
  even in the best authenticated ancient or modern histories
  and that 
  love of truth
  which in some minds is innate and immutable
  necessarily 
  leads to a love of secret memoirs and private anecdotes
  we cannot 
  judge either of the feelings or of the characters of men with perfect 
  accuracy
  from their actions or their appearance in public
  it is from 
  their careless conversations
  their half finished sentences
  that we 
  may hope with the greatest probability of success to discover their real 
  characters
  the life of a great or of a little man written by himself
  
  the familiar letters
  the diary of any individual published by his 
  friends or by his enemies
  after his decease
  are esteemed important 
  literary curiosities
  we are surely justified
  in this eager desire
  to 
  collect the most minute facts relative to the domestic lives
  not only 
  of the great and good
  but even of the worthless and insignificant
  
  since it is only by a comparison of their actual happiness or misery 
  in the privacy of domestic life that we can form a just estimate of the 
  real reward of virtue
  or the real punishment of vice
  that the great 
  are not as happy as they seem
  that the external circumstances of 
  fortune and rank do not constitute felicity
  is asserted by every 
  moralist
  the historian can seldom
  consistently with his dignity
  pause 
  to illustrate this truth
  it is therefore to the biographer we must have 
  recourse
  after we have beheld splendid characters playing their parts 
  on the great theatre of the world
  with all the advantages of stage 
  effect and decoration
  we anxiously beg to be admitted behind the 
  scenes
  that we may take a nearer view of the actors and actresses
  
   
  some may perhaps imagine that the value of biography depends upon the 
  judgment and taste of the biographer
  but on the contrary it may be 
  maintained
  that the merits of a biographer are inversely as the 
  extent of his intellectual powers and of his literary talents
  a plain 
  unvarnished tale is preferable to the most highly ornamented narrative
  
  where we see that a man has the power
  we may naturally suspect that 
  he has the will to deceive us
  and those who are used to literary 
  manufacture know how much is often sacrificed to the rounding of a 
  period
  or the pointing of an antithesis
  
   
  that the ignorant may have their prejudices as well as the learned 
  cannot be disputed
  but we see and despise vulgar errors
  we never 
  bow to the authority of him who has no great name to sanction his 
  absurdities
  the partiality which blinds a biographer to the defects of 
  his hero
  in proportion as it is gross
  ceases to be dangerous
  but 
  if it be concealed by the appearance of candour
  which men of great 
  abilities best know how to assume
  it endangers our judgment sometimes
  
  and sometimes our morals
  if her grace the duchess of newcastle
  instead 
  of penning her lord s elaborate eulogium
  had undertaken to write the 
  life of savage
  we should not have been in any danger of mistaking an 
  idle
  ungrateful libertine for a man of genius and virtue
  the talents 
  of a biographer are often fatal to his reader
  for these reasons the 
  public often judiciously countenance those who
  without sagacity 
  to discriminate character
  without elegance of style to relieve the 
  tediousness of narrative
  without enlargement of mind to draw any 
  conclusions from the facts they relate
  simply pour forth anecdotes
  
  and retail conversations
  with all the minute prolixity of a gossip in a 
  country town
  
   
  the author of the following memoirs has upon these grounds fair claims 
  to the public favour and attention
  he was an illiterate old steward
  
  whose partiality to the family
  in which he was bred and born
  must be 
  obvious to the reader
  he tells the history of the rackrent family in 
  his vernacular idiom
  and in the full confidence that sir patrick
  
  sir murtagh
  sir kit
  and sir condy rackrent s affairs will be as 
  interesting to all the world as they were to himself
  those who were 
  acquainted with the manners of a certain class of the gentry of ireland 
  some years ago
  will want no evidence of the truth of honest thady s 
  narrative
  to those who are totally unacquainted with ireland
  the 
  following memoirs will perhaps be scarcely intelligible
  or probably 
  they may appear perfectly incredible
  for the information of the 
  ignorant english reader
  a few notes have been subjoined by the editor
  
  and he had it once in contemplation to translate the language of thady 
  into plain english
  but thady s idiom is incapable of translation
  and
  
  besides
  the authenticity of his story would have been more exposed 
  to doubt if it were not told in his own characteristic manner
  several 
  years ago he related to the editor the history of the rackrent family
  
  and it was with some difficulty that he was persuaded to have it 
  committed to writing
  however
  his feelings for  the honour of the 
  family
   as he expressed himself
  prevailed over his habitual laziness
  
  and he at length completed the narrative which is now laid before the 
  public
  
   
  the editor hopes his readers will observe that these are  tales of other 
  times
   that the manners depicted in the following pages are not those 
  of the present age
  the race of the rackrents has long since been 
  extinct in ireland
  and the drunken sir patrick
  the litigious 
  sir murtagh
  the fighting sir kit
  and the slovenly sir condy
  are 
  characters which could no more be met with at present in ireland
  than 
  squire western or parson trulliber in england
  there is a time 
  when individuals can bear to be rallied for their past follies 
  and absurdities
  after they have acquired new habits and a new 
  consciousness
  nations
  as well as individuals
  gradually lose 
  attachment to their identity
  and the present generation is amused
  
  rather than offended
  by the ridicule that is thrown upon its ancestors
  
   
  probably we shall soon have it in our power
  in a hundred instances
  to 
  verify the truth of these observations
  
   
  when ireland loses her identity by an union with great britain
  she will 
  look back
  with a smile of good humoured complacency
  on the sir kits 
  and sir condys of her former existence

  having
  out of friendship for the family
  upon whose estate
  praised be 
  heaven
  i and mine have lived rent free time out of mind
  voluntarily 
  undertaken to publish the memoirs of the rackrent family
  i think it my 
  duty to say a few words
  in the first place
  concerning myself
  my real 
  name is thady quirk
  though in the family i have always been known by 
  no other than  honest thady
   afterward
  in the time of sir murtagh
  
  deceased
  i remember to hear them calling me  old thady
   and now i ve 
  come to  poor thady 
  for i wear a long greatcoat winter and summer
  
  which is very handy
  as i never put my arms into the sleeves
  they 
  are as good as new
  though come holantide next i ve had it these seven 
  years
  it holds on by a single button round my neck
  cloak fashion
  
   
   the cloak
  or mantle
  as described by thady
  is of high antiquity
  
  spenser
  in his view of the state of ireland
  proves that it is not
  
  as some have imagined
  peculiarly derived from the scythians
  but that 
   most nations of the world anciently used the mantle
  for the jews used 
  it
  as you may read of elias s mantle
  etc
 
  the chaldees also used it
  
  as you may read in diodorus
  the egyptians likewise used it
  as you may 
  read in herodotus
  and may be gathered by the description of berenice 
  in the greek commentary upon callimachus
  the greeks also used it 
  anciently
  as appeared by venus s mantle lined with stars
  though 
  afterward they changed the form thereof into their cloaks
  called 
  pallai
  as some of the irish also use
  and the ancient latins and romans 
  used it
  as you may read in virgil
  who was a great antiquary
  that 
  evander
  when aeneas came to him at his feast
  did entertain and feast 
  him sitting on the ground
  and lying on mantles
  insomuch that he useth 
  the very word mantile for a mantle   
   
  
 humi mantilia sternunt
 
  
   
  so that it seemeth that the mantle was a general habit to most nations
  
  and not proper to the scythians only
  
   
  spenser knew the convenience of the said mantle
  as housing
  bedding
  
  and clothing
   iren
  because the commodity doth not countervail the 
  discommodity
  for the inconveniences which thereby do arise are much 
  more many
  for it is a fit house for an outlaw
  a meet bed for a rebel
  
  and an apt cloak for a thief
  first
  the outlaw being
  for his many 
  crimes and villanies
  banished from the towns and houses of honest men
  
  and wandering in waste places
  far from danger of law
  maketh his mantle 
  his house
  and under it covereth himself from the wrath of heaven
  from 
  the offence of the earth
  and from the sight of men
  when it raineth
  it 
  is his penthouse
  when it bloweth
  it is his tent
  when it freezeth
  it 
  is his tabernacle
  in summer he can wear it loose
  in winter he can wrap 
  it close
  at all times he can use it
  never heavy
  never cumbersome
  
  likewise for a rebel it is as serviceable
  for in this war that he 
  maketh  if at least it deserves the name of war 
  when he still flieth 
  from his foe
  and lurketh in the thick woods  this should be black bogs  
  and straight passages
  waiting for advantages
  it is his bed
  yea
  and 
  almost his household stuff
    
   
  to look at me
  you would hardly think  poor thady  was the father of 
  attorney quirk
  he is a high gentleman
  and never minds what poor thady 
  says
  and having better than fifteen hundred a year
  landed estate
  
  looks down upon honest thady
  but i wash my hands of his doings
  and as 
  i have lived so will i die
  true and loyal to the family
  the family 
  of the rackrents is
  i am proud to say
  one of the most ancient in the 
  kingdom
  everybody knows this is not the old family name
  which was 
  o shaughlin
  related to the kings of ireland  but that was before my 
  time
  my grandfather was driver to the great sir patrick o shaughlin
  
  and i heard him
  when i was a boy
  telling how the castle rackrent 
  estate came to sir patrick
  sir tallyhoo rackrent was cousin german to 
  him
  and had a fine estate of his own
  only never a gate upon it
  it 
  being his maxim that a car was the best gate
  poor gentleman
  he lost a 
  fine hunter and his life
  at last
  by it
  all in one day s hunt
  but i 
  ought to bless that day
  for the estate came straight into the family
  
  upon one condition
  which sir patrick o shaughlin at the time took sadly 
  to heart
  they say
  but thought better of it afterwards
  seeing how 
  large a stake depended upon it
  that he should
  by act of parliament
  
  take and bear the surname and arms of rackrent
  
   
  now it was that the world was to see what was in sir patrick
  on coming 
  into the estate he gave the finest entertainment ever was heard of in 
  the country
  not a man could stand after supper but sir patrick himself 
  who could sit out the best man in ireland
  let alone the three kingdoms 
  itself  see glossary 2 
  he had his house
  from one year s end to 
  another
  as full of company as ever it could hold
  and fuller
  for 
  rather than be left out of the parties at castle rackrent
  many 
  gentlemen
  and those men of the first consequence and landed estates in 
  the country  such as the o neills of ballynagrotty
  and the moneygawls 
  of mount juliet s town
  and o shannons of new town tullyhog  made it 
  their choice
  often and often
  when there was no room to be had for love 
  nor money
  in long winter nights
  to sleep in the chicken house
  which 
  sir patrick had fitted up for the purpose of accommodating his 
  friends and the public in general
  who honoured him with their company 
  unexpectedly at castle rackrent
  and this went on i can t tell you how 
  long
  the whole country rang with his praises
   long life to him
  i m 
  sure i love to look upon his picture
  now opposite to me
  though i never 
  saw him
  he must have been a portly gentleman  his neck something 
  short
  and remarkable for the largest pimple on his nose
  which
  by his 
  particular desire
  is still extant in his picture
  said to be a striking 
  likeness
  though taken when young
  he is said also to be the inventor of 
  raspberry whisky
  which is very likely
  as nobody has ever appeared to 
  dispute it with him
  and as there still exists a broken punch bowl at 
  castle rackrent
  in the garret
  with an inscription to that effect  a 
  great curiosity
  a few days before his death he was very merry
  it being 
  his honour s birthday
  he called my grandfather in  god bless him
   to 
  drink the company s health
  and filled a bumper himself
  but could not 
  carry it to his head
  on account of the great shake in his hand
  on this 
  he cast his joke
  saying
   what would my poor father say to me if he was 
  to pop out of the grave
  and see me now
  i remember when i was a little 
  boy
  the first bumper of claret he gave me after dinner
  how he praised 
  me for carrying it so steady to my mouth
  here s my thanks to him  a 
  bumper toast
   then he fell to singing the favourite song he learned 
  from his father  for the last time
  poor gentleman  he sung it that 
  night as loud and as hearty as ever
  with a chorus
  
   
       he that goes to bed
  and goes to bed sober
  
       falls as the leaves do
  falls as the leaves do
  and dies in 
       october
  
        but he that goes to bed
  and goes to bed mellow
  
       lives as he ought to do
  lives as he ought to do
  and dies an 
       honest fellow
  
   
  sir patrick died that night
  just as the company rose to drink his 
  health with three cheers
  he fell down in a sort of fit
  and was carried 
  off
  they sat it out
  and were surprised
  on inquiry in the morning
  to 
  find that it was all over with poor sir patrick
  never did any gentleman 
  live and die more beloved in the country by rich and poor
  his funeral 
  was such a one as was never known before or since in the county
  all 
  the gentlemen in the three counties were at it
  far and near
  how they 
  flocked
  my great grandfather said
  that to see all the women
  even in 
  their red cloaks
  you would have taken them for the army drawn out
  then 
  such a fine whillaluh
   see glossary 3  you might have heard it to the 
  farthest end of the county
  and happy the man who could get but a sight 
  of the hearse
  but who d have thought it
  just as all was going on 
  right
  through his own town they were passing
  when the body was seized 
  for debt  a rescue was apprehended from the mob
  but the heir
  who 
  attended the funeral
  was against that
  for fear of consequences
  seeing 
  that those villains who came to serve acted under the disguise of the 
  law
  so
  to be sure
  the law must take its course
  and little gain had 
  the creditors for their pains
  first and foremost
  they had the curses 
  of the country
  and sir murtagh rackrent
  the new heir
  in the next 
  place
  on account of this affront to the body
  refused to pay a shilling 
  of the debts
  in which he was countenanced by all the best gentlemen of 
  property
  and others of his acquaintance
  sir murtagh alleging in all 
  companies that he all along meant to pay his father s debts of honour
  
  but the moment the law was taken of him
  there was an end of honour 
  to be sure
  it was whispered  but none but the enemies of the family 
  believe it  that this was all a sham seizure to get quit of the debts 
  which he had bound himself to pay in honour
  
   
  it s a long time ago
  there s no saying how it was
  but this for 
  certain
  the new man did not take at all after the old gentleman
  
  the cellars were never filled after his death
  and no open house
  or 
  anything as it used to be
  the tenants even were sent away without their 
  whisky  see glossary 4 
  i was ashamed myself
  and knew not what to say 
  for the honour of the family
  but i made the best of a bad case
  and 
  laid it all at my lady s door
  for i did not like her anyhow
  nor 
  anybody else
  she was of the family of the skinflints
  and a widow
  it 
  was a strange match for sir murtagh
  the people in the country thought 
  he demeaned himself greatly  see glossary 5 
  but i said nothing
  i 
  knew how it was
  sir murtagh was a great lawyer
  and looked to the great 
  skinflint estate
  there
  however
  he overshot himself
  for though one of 
  the co heiresses
  he was never the better for her
  for she outlived him 
  many s the long day  he could not see that to be sure when he married 
  her
  i must say for her
  she made him the best of wives
  being a very 
  notable
  stirring woman
  and looking close to everything
  but i always 
  suspected she had scotch blood in her veins
  anything else i could 
  have looked over in her
  from a regard to the family
  she was a strict 
  observer
  for self and servants
  of lent
  and all fast days
  but not 
  holidays
  one of the maids having fainted three times the last day of 
  lent
  to keep soul and body together
  we put a morsel of roast beef into 
  her mouth
  which came from sir murtagh s dinner
  who never fasted
  not 
  he
  but somehow or other it unfortunately reached my lady s ears
  and 
  the priest of the parish had a complaint made of it the next day
  and 
  the poor girl was forced
  as soon as she could walk
  to do penance for 
  it
  before she could get any peace or absolution
  in the house or out 
  of it
  however
  my lady was very charitable in her own way
  she had a 
  charity school for poor children
  where they were taught to read and 
  write gratis
  and where they were kept well to spinning gratis for my 
  lady in return
  for she had always heaps of duty yarn from the tenants
  
  and got all her household linen out of the estate from first to last
  
  for after the spinning
  the weavers on the estate took it in hand for 
  nothing
  because of the looms my lady s interest could get from the 
  linen board to distribute gratis
  then there was a bleach yard near us
  
  and the tenant dare refuse my lady nothing
  for fear of a lawsuit sir 
  murtagh kept hanging over him about the watercourse
  with these ways 
  of managing
   tis surprising how cheap my lady got things done
  and how 
  proud she was of it
  her table the same way
  kept for next to nothing 
   see glossary 6 
  duty fowls
  and duty turkeys
  and duty geese
  came as 
  fast as we could eat  em
  for my lady kept a sharp lookout
  and knew 
  to a tub of butter everything the tenants had
  all round
  they knew her 
  way
  and what with fear of driving for rent and sir murtagh s lawsuits
  
  they were kept in such good order
  they never thought of coming near 
  castle rackrent without a present of something or other  nothing too 
  much or too little for my lady  eggs
  honey
  butter
  meal
  fish
  game
  
  grouse
  and herrings
  fresh or salt
  all went for something
  as for 
  their young pigs
  we had them
  and the best bacon and hams they could 
  make up
  with all young chickens in spring
  but they were a set of poor 
  wretches
  and we had nothing but misfortunes with them
  always breaking 
  and running away
  this
  sir murtagh and my lady said
  was all their 
  former landlord sir patrick s fault
  who let  em all get the half year s 
  rent into arrear
  there was something in that to be sure
  but sir 
  murtagh was as much the contrary way
  for let alone making english 
  tenants  see glossary 7  of them
  every soul
  he was always driving 
  and driving
  and pounding and pounding
  and canting and canting  see 
  glossary 8 
  and replevying and replevying
  and he made a good living 
  of trespassing cattle
  there was always some tenant s pig
  or horse
  or 
  cow
  or calf
  or goose
  trespassing
  which was so great a gain to sir 
  murtagh
  that he did not like to hear me talk of repairing fences
  then 
  his heriots and duty work  see glossary 9  brought him in something
  his 
  turf was cut
  his potatoes set and dug
  his hay brought home
  and
  in 
  short
  all the work about his house done for nothing
  for in all our 
  leases there were strict clauses heavy with penalties
  which sir murtagh 
  knew well how to enforce
  so many days  duty work of man and horse
  from 
  every tenant
  he was to have
  and had
  every year
  and when a man vexed 
  him
  why
  the finest day he could pitch on
  when the cratur was getting 
  in his own harvest
  or thatching his cabin
  sir murtagh made it a 
  principle to call upon him and his horse
  so he taught  em all
  as he 
  said
  to know the law of landlord and tenant
  as for law
  i believe no 
  man
  dead or alive
  ever loved it so well as sir murtagh
  he had once 
  sixteen suits pending at a time
  and i never saw him so much himself
  
  roads
  lanes
  bogs
  wells
  ponds
  eel wires
  orchards
  trees
  tithes
  
  vagrants
  gravelpits
  sandpits
  dunghills
  and nuisances
  everything 
  upon the face of the earth furnished him good matter for a suit
  he used 
  to boast that he had a lawsuit for every letter in the alphabet
  how 
  i used to wonder to see sir murtagh in the midst of the papers in his 
  office
  why
  he could hardly turn about for them
  i made bold to shrug 
  my shoulders once in his presence
  and thanked my stars i was not born a 
  gentleman to so much toil and trouble
  but sir murtagh took me up short 
  with his old proverb
   learning is better than house or land
   out of 
  forty nine suits which he had
  he never lost one but seventeen  see 
  glossary 10 
  the rest he gained with costs
  double costs
  treble costs 
  sometimes
  but even that did not pay
  he was a very learned man in the 
  law
  and had the character of it
  but how it was i can t tell
  these 
  suits that he carried cost him a power of money
  in the end he sold some 
  hundreds a year of the family estate
  but he was a very learned man in 
  the law
  and i know nothing of the matter
  except having a great regard 
  for the family
  and i could not help grieving when he sent me to post up 
  notices of the sale of the fee simple of the lands and appurtenances of 
  timoleague
  
   
   i know
  honest thady
   says he
  to comfort me
   what i m about better 
  than you do
  i m only selling to get the ready money wanting to carry on 
  my suit with spirit with the nugents of carrickashaughlin
   
   
  he was very sanguine about that suit with the nugents of 
  carrickashaughlin
  he could have gained it
  they say
  for certain
  had 
  it pleased heaven to have spared him to us
  and it would have been 
  at the least a plump two thousand a year in his way
  but things were 
  ordered otherwise  for the best to be sure
  he dug up a fairy mount 
  against my advice
  and had no luck afterwards
   these fairy mounts are 
  called ant hills in england
  they are held in high reverence by the 
  common people in ireland
  a gentleman
  who in laying out his lawn had 
  occasion to level one of these hillocks
  could not prevail upon any of 
  his labourers to begin the ominous work
  he was obliged to take a loy 
  from one of their reluctant hands
  and began the attack himself
  the 
  labourers agreed that the vengeance of the fairies would fall upon 
  the head of the presumptuous mortal who first disturbed them in their 
  retreat  see glossary 11 
   though a learned man in the law
  he was a 
  little too incredulous in other matters
  i warned him that i heard the 
  very banshee that my grandfather heard under sir patrick s window a few 
  days before his death
   the banshee is a species of aristocratic fairy
  
  who
  in the shape of a little hideous old woman
  has been known to 
  appear
  and heard to sing in a mournful supernatural voice under the 
  windows of great houses
  to warn the family that some of them are soon 
  to die
  in the last century every great family in ireland had a banshee
  
  who attended regularly
  but latterly their visits and songs have been 
  discontinued
   but sir murtagh thought nothing of the banshee
  nor 
  of his cough
  with a spitting of blood
  brought on
  i understand
  by 
  catching cold in attending the courts
  and overstraining his chest with 
  making himself heard in one of his favourite causes
  he was a great 
  speaker with a powerful voice
  but his last speech was not in the courts 
  at all
  he and my lady
  though both of the same way of thinking in some 
  things
  and though she was as good a wife and great economist as you 
  could see
  and he the best of husbands
  as to looking into his affairs
  
  and making money for his family
  yet i don t know how it was
  they had 
  a great deal of sparring and jarring between them
  my lady had her privy 
  purse
  and she had her weed ashes  see glossary 12 
  and her sealing 
  money  see glossary 13  upon the signing of all the leases
  with 
  something to buy gloves besides
  and
  besides
  again often took money 
  from the tenants
  if offered properly
  to speak for them to sir murtagh 
  about abatements and renewals
  now the weed ashes and the glove money he 
  allowed her clear perquisites
  though once when he saw her in a new gown 
  saved out of the weed ashes
  he told her to my face  for he could say a 
  sharp thing  that she should not put on her weeds before her husband s 
  death
  but in a dispute about an abatement my lady would have the last 
  word
  and sir murtagh grew mad  see glossary 14 
  i was within hearing 
  of the door
  and now i wish i had made bold to step in
  he spoke so 
  loud
  the whole kitchen was out on the stairs  see glossary 15 
  all 
  on a sudden he stopped
  and my lady too
  something has surely happened
  
  thought i
  and so it was
  for sir murtagh in his passion broke a 
  blood vessel
  and all the law in the land could do nothing in that case
  
  my lady sent for five physicians
  but sir murtagh died
  and was buried
  
  she had a fine jointure settled upon her
  and took herself away
  to the 
  great joy of the tenantry
  i never said anything one way or the other 
  whilst she was part of the family
  but got up to see her go at three 
  o clock in the morning
  
   
   it s a fine morning
  honest thady
   says she
   good bye to ye
   and 
  into the carriage she stepped
  without a word more
  good or bad
  or even 
  half a crown
  but i made my bow
  and stood to see her safe out of sight 
  for the sake of the family
  
   
  then we were all bustle in the house
  which made me keep out of the way
  
  for i walk slow and hate a bustle
  but the house was all hurry skurry
  
  preparing for my new master
  sir murtagh
  i forgot to notice
  had no 
  childer  childer
  this is the manner in which many of thady s rank
  
  and others in ireland
  formerly pronounced the word children 
  so the 
  rackrent estate went to his younger brother
  a young dashing officer
  
  who came amongst us before i knew for the life of me whereabouts i was
  
  in a gig or some of them things
  with another spark along with him
  
  and led horses
  and servants
  and dogs
  and scarce a place to put any 
  christian of them into
  for my late lady had sent all the feather beds 
  off before her
  and blankets and household linen
  down to the very 
  knife cloths
  on the cars to dublin
  which were all her own
  lawfully 
  paid for out of her own money
  so the house was quite bare
  and my young 
  master
  the moment ever he set foot in it out of his gig
  thought all 
  those things must come of themselves
  i believe
  for he never looked 
  after anything at all
  but harum scarum called for everything as if we 
  were conjurors
  or he in a public house
  for my part
  i could not bestir 
  myself anyhow
  i had been so much used to my late master and mistress
  
  all was upside down with me
  and the new servants in the servants  hall 
  were quite out of my way
  i had nobody to talk to
  and if it had not 
  been for my pipe and tobacco
  should
  i verily believe
  have broke my 
  heart for poor sir murtagh
  
   
  but one morning my new master caught a glimpse of me as i was looking at 
  his horse s heels
  in hopes of a word from him
   and is that old thady
   
  says he
  as he got into his gig
  i loved him from that day to this
  
  his voice was so like the family
  and he threw me a guinea out of his 
  waistcoat pocket
  as he drew up the reins with the other hand
  his horse 
  rearing too
  i thought i never set my eyes on a finer figure of a man
  
  quite another sort from sir murtagh
  though withal
  to me
  a family 
  likeness
  a fine life we should have led
  had he stayed amongst us
  god 
  bless him
  he valued a guinea as little as any man
  money to him was no 
  more than dirt
  and his gentleman and groom
  and all belonging to him
  
  the same
  but the sporting season over
  he grew tired of the place
  and 
  having got down a great architect for the house
  and an improver for 
  the grounds
  and seen their plans and elevations
  he fixed a day for 
  settling with the tenants
  but went off in a whirlwind to town
  just as 
  some of them came into the yard in the morning
  a circular letter came 
  next post from the new agent
  with news that the master was sailed for 
  england
  and he must remit l500 to bath for his use before a fortnight 
  was at an end
  bad news still for the poor tenants
  no change still for 
  the better with them
  sir kit rackrent
  my young master
  left all to the 
  agent
  and though he had the spirit of a prince
  and lived away to the 
  honour of his country abroad
  which i was proud to hear of
  what were 
  we the better for that at home
  the agent was one of your middlemen
  who 
  grind the face of the poor
  and can never bear a man with a hat upon his 
  head
  he ferreted the tenants out of their lives
  not a week without a 
  call for money
  drafts upon drafts from sir kit
  but i laid it all to 
  the fault of the agent
  for
  says i
  what can sir kit do with so much 
  cash
  and he a single man
  
   
   middlemen
   there was a class of men
  termed middlemen
  in ireland
  who 
  took large farms on long leases from gentlemen of landed property
  and 
  let the land again in small portions to the poor
  as under tenants
  at 
  exorbitant rents
  the head landlord
  as he was called
  seldom saw his 
  under tenants
  but if he could not get the middleman to pay him his rent 
  punctually
  he went to his land
  and drove the land for his rent
  that 
  is to say
  he sent his steward
  or bailiff
  or driver
  to the land to 
  seize the cattle
  hay
  corn
  flax
  oats
  or potatoes
  belonging to the 
  under tenants
  and proceeded to sell these for his rents
  it sometimes 
  happened that these unfortunate tenants paid their rent twice over
  once 
  to the middleman
  and once to the head landlord
  
   
  the characteristics of a middleman were servility to his superiors and 
  tyranny towards his inferiors
  the poor detested this race of beings
  
  in speaking to them
  however
  they always used the most abject language
  
  and the most humble tone and posture   please your honour
  and please 
  your honour s honour
   they knew must be repeated as a charm at the 
  beginning and end of every equivocating
  exculpatory
  or supplicatory 
  sentence
  and they were much more alert in doffing their caps to those 
  new men than to those of what they call good old families
  a witty 
  carpenter once termed these middlemen journeymen gentlemen
   
   
  but still it went
  rents must be all paid up to the day
  and afore
  
  no allowance for improving tenants
  no consideration for those who had 
  built upon their farms
  no sooner was a lease out
  but the land was 
  advertised to the highest bidder
  all the old tenants turned out
  when 
  they spent their substance in the hope and trust of a renewal from 
  the landlord
  all was now let at the highest penny to a parcel of poor 
  wretches
  who meant to run away
  and did so
  after taking two crops out 
  of the ground
  then fining down the year s rent came into fashion 
   see glossary 16   anything for the ready penny
  and with all this and 
  presents to the agent and the driver  see glossary 17 
  there was no 
  such thing as standing it
  i said nothing
  for i had a regard for the 
  family
  but i walked about thinking if his honour sir kit knew all 
  this
  it would go hard with him but he d see us righted
  not that i had 
  anything for my own share to complain of
  for the agent was always very 
  civil to me when he came down into the country
  and took a great deal of 
  notice of my son jason
  jason quirk
  though he be my son
  i must say was 
  a good scholar from his birth
  and a very  cute lad
  i thought to make 
  him a priest  see glossary 18 
  but he did better for himself
  seeing 
  how he was as good a clerk as any in the county
  the agent gave him his 
  rent accounts to copy
  which he did first of all for the pleasure of 
  obliging the gentleman
  and would take nothing at all for his trouble
  
  but was always proud to serve the family
  by and by a good farm bounding 
  us to the east fell into his honour s hands
  and my son put in a 
  proposal for it
  why shouldn t he
  as well as another
  the proposals 
  all went over to the master at the bath
  who knowing no more of the land 
  than the child unborn
  only having once been out a grousing on it before 
  he went to england
  and the value of lands
  as the agent informed him
  
  falling every year in ireland
  his honour wrote over in all haste a bit 
  of a letter
  saying he left it all to the agent
  and that he must let it 
  as well as he could  to the best bidder
  to be sure  and send him over 
  l200 by return of post
  with this the agent gave me a hint
  and i spoke 
  a good word for my son
  and gave out in the country that nobody need bid 
  against us
  so his proposal was just the thing
  and he a good tenant
  
  and he got a promise of an abatement in the rent after the first year
  
  for advancing the half year s rent at signing the lease
  which was 
  wanting to complete the agent s l200 by the return of the post
  with 
  all which my master wrote back he was well satisfied
  about this time 
  we learnt from the agent
  as a great secret
  how the money went so fast
  
  and the reason of the thick coming of the master s drafts
  he was a 
  little too fond of play
  and bath
  they say
  was no place for no young 
  man of his fortune
  where there were so many of his own countrymen
  
  too
  hunting him up and down
  day and night
  who had nothing to lose
  
  at last
  at christmas
  the agent wrote over to stop the drafts
  for he 
  could raise no more money on bond or mortgage
  or from the tenants
  or 
  anyhow
  nor had he any more to lend himself
  and desired at the same 
  time to decline the agency for the future
  wishing sir kit his health 
  and happiness
  and the compliments of the season
  for i saw the letter 
  before ever it was sealed
  when my son copied it
  when the answer came 
  there was a new turn in affairs
  and the agent was turned out
  and my 
  son jason
  who had corresponded privately with his honour occasionally 
  on business
  was forthwith desired by his honour to take the accounts 
  into his own hands
  and look them over
  till further orders
  it was 
  a very spirited letter to be sure
  sir kit sent his service
  and the 
  compliments of the season
  in return to the agent
  and he would fight 
  him with pleasure to morrow
  or any day
  for sending him such a letter
  
  if he was born a gentleman
  which he was sorry  for both their sakes  
  to find  too late  he was not
  then
  in a private postscript
  he 
  condescended to tell us that all would be speedily settled to his 
  satisfaction
  and we should turn over a new leaf
  for he was going to be 
  married in a fortnight to the grandest heiress in england
  and had only 
  immediate occasion at present for l200
  as he would not choose to touch 
  his lady s fortune for travelling expenses home to castle rackrent
  
  where he intended to be
  wind and weather permitting
  early in the 
  next month
  and desired fires
  and the house to be painted
  and the new 
  building to go on as fast as possible
  for the reception of him and his 
  lady before that time
  with several words besides in the letter
  which 
  we could not make out because
  god bless him
  he wrote in such a flurry
  
  my heart warmed to my new lady when i read this
  i was almost afraid it 
  was too good news to be true
  but the girls fell to scouring
  and it was 
  well they did
  for we soon saw his marriage in the paper
  to a lady with 
  i don t know how many tens of thousand pounds to her fortune
  then i 
  watched the post office for his landing
  and the news came to my son 
  of his and the bride being in dublin
  and on the way home to castle 
  rackrent
  we had bonfires all over the country
  expecting him down the 
  next day
  and we had his coming of age still to celebrate
  which he had 
  not time to do properly before he left the country
  therefore
  a great 
  ball was expected
  and great doings upon his coming
  as it were
  fresh 
  to take possession of his ancestors  estate
  i never shall forget the 
  day he came home
  we had waited and waited all day long till eleven 
  o clock at night
  and i was thinking of sending the boy to lock the 
  gates
  and giving them up for that night
  when there came the carriages 
  thundering up to the great hall door
  i got the first sight of the 
  bride
  for when the carriage door opened
  just as she had her foot on 
  the steps
  i held the flam full in her face to light her  see glossary 
  19 
  at which she shut her eyes
  but i had a full view of the rest of 
  her
  and greatly shocked i was
  for by that light she was little better 
  than a blackamoor
  and seemed crippled
  but that was only sitting so 
  long in the chariot
  
   
   you re kindly welcome to castle rackrent
  my lady
   says i 
   recollecting who she was 
   did your honour hear of the bonfires
   
   
  his honour spoke never a word
  nor so much as handed her up the 
  steps  he looked to me no more like himself than nothing at all
  i know 
  i took him for the skeleton of his honour
  i was not sure what to say 
  next to one or t other
  but seeing she was a stranger in a foreign 
  country
  i thought it but right to speak cheerful to her
  so i went back 
  again to the bonfires
  
   
   my lady
   says i
  as she crossed the hall
   there would have been 
  fifty times as many
  but for fear of the horses
  and frightening your 
  ladyship
  jason and i forbid them
  please your honour
   
   
  with that she looked at me a little bewildered
  
   
   will i have a fire lighted in the state room to night
   was the next 
  question i put to her
  but never a word she answered
  so i concluded she 
  could not speak a word of english
  and was from foreign parts
  the short 
  and the long of it was
  i couldn t tell what to make of her
  so i left 
  her to herself
  and went straight down to the servants  hall to learn 
  something for certain about her
  sir kit s own man was tired
  but the 
  groom set him a talking at last
  and we had it all out before ever i 
  closed my eyes that night
  the bride might well be a great fortune  she 
  was a jewish by all accounts
  who are famous for their great riches
  i 
  had never seen any of that tribe or nation before
  and could only gather 
  that she spoke a strange kind of english of her own
  that she could not 
  abide pork or sausages
  and went neither to church or mass
  mercy upon 
  his honour s poor soul
  thought i
  what will become of him and his
  
  and all of us
  with his heretic blackamoor at the head of the castle 
  rackrent estate
  i never slept a wink all night for thinking of it
  
  but before the servants i put my pipe in my mouth
  and kept my mind to 
  myself
  for i had a great regard for the family
  and after this
  when 
  strange gentlemen s servants came to the house
  and would begin to talk 
  about the bride
  i took care to put the best foot foremost
  and passed 
  her for a nabob in the kitchen
  which accounted for her dark complexion 
  and everything
  
   
  the very morning after they came home
  however
  i saw plain enough 
  how things were between sir kit and my lady
  though they were walking 
  together arm in arm after breakfast
  looking at the new building and the 
  improvements
  
   
   old thady
   said my master
  just as he used to do
   how do you do
   
   
   very well
  i thank your honour s honour
   said i
  but i saw he was not 
  well pleased
  and my heart was in my mouth as i walked along after him
  
   
   is the large room damp
  thady
   said his honour
  
   
   oh damp
  your honour
  how should it be but as dry as a bone
   says 
  i
   after all the fires we have kept in it day and night
  it s the 
  barrack room your honour s talking on  see glossary 20 
   
   
   and what is a barrack room
  pray
  my dear
   were the first words i ever 
  heard out of my lady s lips
  
   
   no matter
  my dear
   said he
  and went on talking to me
  ashamed like 
  i should witness her ignorance
  to be sure
  to hear her talk one might 
  have taken her for an innocent  see glossary 21 
  for it was
   what s 
  this
  sir kit
  and what s that
  sir kit
   all the way we went
  to be 
  sure
  sir kit had enough to do to answer her
  
   
   and what do you call that
  sir kit
   said she
   that  that looks like 
  a pile of black bricks
  pray
  sir kit
   
   
   my turf stack
  my dear
   said my master
  and bit his lip
  
   
  where have you lived
  my lady
  all your life
  not to know a turf stack 
  when you see it
  thought i
  but i said nothing
  then by and by she takes 
  out her glass
  and begins spying over the country
  
   
   and what s all that black swamp out yonder
  sir kit
   says she
  
   
   my bog
  my dear
   says he
  and went on whistling
  
   
   it s a very ugly prospect
  my dear
   says she
  
   
   you don t see it
  my dear
   says he
   for we ve planted it out
  when 
  the trees grow up in summer time    says he
  
   
   where are the trees
   said she
   my dear
   still looking through her 
  glass
  
   
   you are blind
  my dear
   says he
   what are these under your eyes
   
   
   these shrubs
   said she
  
   
   trees
   said he
  
   
   maybe they are what you call trees in ireland
  my dear
   said she
   but 
  they are not a yard high
  are they
   
   
   they were planted out but last year
  my lady
   says i
  to soften 
  matters between them
  for i saw she was going the way to make his honour 
  mad with her
   they are very well grown for their age
  and you ll not 
  see the bog of allyballycarrick o shaughlin at all at all through 
  the skreen
  when once the leaves come out
  but
  my lady
  you must not 
  quarrel with any part or parcel of allyballycarricko shaughlin
  for you 
  don t know how many hundred years that same bit of bog has been in the 
  family
  we would not part with the bog of allyballycarricko shaughlin 
  upon no account at all
  it cost the late sir murtagh two hundred good 
  pounds to defend his title to it and boundaries against the o learys
  
  who cut a road through it
   
   
  now one would have thought this would have been hint enough for my lady
  
  but she fell to laughing like one out of their right mind
  and made me 
  say the name of the bog over
  for her to get it by heart
  a dozen times
  
  then she must ask me how to spell it
  and what was the meaning of it in 
  english  sir kit standing by whistling all the while
  i verily believed 
  she laid the corner stone of all her future misfortunes at that very 
  instant
  but i said no more
  only looked at sir kit
  
   
  there were no balls
  no dinners
  no doings
  the country was all 
  disappointed  sir kit s gentleman said in a whisper to me
  it was all my 
  lady s own fault
  because she was so obstinate about the cross
  
   
   what cross
   says i
   is it about her being a heretic
   
   
   oh
  no such matter
   says he
   my master does not mind her heresies
  
  but her diamond cross it s worth i can t tell you how much
  and she has 
  thousands of english pounds concealed in diamonds about her
  which she 
  as good as promised to give up to my master before he married
  but now 
  she won t part with any of them
  and she must take the consequences
   
   
  her honeymoon
  at least her irish honeymoon
  was scarcely well over
  
  when his honour one morning said to me
   thady
  buy me a pig
   and then 
  the sausages were ordered
  and here was the first open breaking out of 
  my lady s troubles
  my lady came down herself into the kitchen to speak 
  to the cook about the sausages
  and desired never to see them more at 
  her table
  now my master had ordered them
  and my lady knew that
  the 
  cook took my lady s part
  because she never came down into the kitchen
  
  and was young and innocent in housekeeping
  which raised her pity
  
  besides
  said she
  at her own table
  surely my lady should order and 
  disorder what she pleases
  but the cook soon changed her note
  for my 
  master made it a principle to have the sausages
  and swore at her for a 
  jew herself
  till he drove her fairly out of the kitchen
  then
  for fear 
  of her place
  and because he threatened that my lady should give her no 
  discharge without the sausages
  she gave up
  and from that day forward 
  always sausages
  or bacon
  or pig meat in some shape or other
  went up 
  to table
  upon which my lady shut herself up in her own room
  and my 
  master said she might stay there
  with an oath
  and to make sure of her
  
  he turned the key in the door
  and kept it ever after in his pocket
  we 
  none of us ever saw or heard her speak for seven years after that
  he 
  carried her dinner himself
  
   
   this part of the history of the rackrent family can scarcely be thought 
  credible
  but in justice to honest thady
  it is hoped the reader 
  will recollect the history of the celebrated lady cathcart s conjugal 
  imprisonment
  the editor was acquainted with colonel m guire
  lady 
  cathcart s husband
  he has lately seen and questioned the maid servant 
  who lived with colonel m guire during the time of lady cathcart s 
  imprisonment
  her ladyship was locked up in her own house for many 
  years
  during which period her husband was visited by the neighbouring 
  gentry
  and it was his regular custom at dinner to send his compliments 
  to lady cathcart
  informing her that the company had the honour to drink 
  her ladyship s health
  and begging to know whether there was anything 
  at table that she would like to eat
  the answer was always
   lady 
  cathcart s compliments
  and she has everything she wants
   an instance 
  of honesty in a poor irishwoman deserves to be recorded
  lady cathcart 
  had some remarkably fine diamonds
  which she had concealed from her 
  husband
  and which she was anxious to get out of the house
  lest he 
  should discover them
  she had neither servant nor friend to whom she 
  could entrust them
  but she had observed a poor beggar woman
  who used 
  to come to the house
  she spoke to her from the window of the room in 
  which she was confined
  the woman promised to do what she desired
  and 
  lady cathcart threw a parcel containing the jewels to her
  the poor 
  woman carried them to the person to whom they were directed
  and several 
  years afterwards
  when lady cathcart recovered her liberty
  she received 
  her diamonds safely
  
   
  at colonel m guire s death her ladyship was released
  the editor
  within 
  this year
  saw the gentleman who accompanied her to england after her 
  husband s death
  when she first was told of his death she imagined that 
  the news was not true
  and that it was told only with an intention of 
  deceiving her
  at his death she had scarcely clothes sufficient to cover 
  her
  she wore a red wig
  looked scared
  and her understanding seemed 
  stupefied
  she said that she scarcely knew one human creature from 
  another
  her imprisonment lasted above twenty years
  these circumstances 
  may appear strange to an english reader
  but there is no danger in 
  the present times that any individual should exercise such tyranny as 
  colonel m guire s with impunity
  the power being now all in the hands of 
  government
  and there being no possibility of obtaining from parliament 
  an act of indemnity for any cruelties
   
   
  then his honour had a great deal of company to dine with him
  and balls 
  in the house
  and was as gay and gallant
  and as much himself as before 
  he was married
  and at dinner he always drank my lady rackrent s good 
  health and so did the company
  and he sent out always a servant with 
  his compliments to my lady rackrent
  and the company was drinking her 
  ladyship s health
  and begged to know if there was anything at table he 
  might send her
  and the man came back
  after the sham errand
  with 
  my lady rackrent s compliments
  and she was very much obliged to sir 
  kit  she did not wish for anything
  but drank the company s health
  the 
  country
  to be sure
  talked and wondered at my lady s being shut up
  
  but nobody chose to interfere or ask any impertinent questions
  for they 
  knew my master was a man very apt to give a short answer himself
  and 
  likely to call a man out for it afterwards
  he was a famous shot
  had 
  killed his man before he came of age
  and nobody scarce dared look at 
  him whilst at bath
  sir kit s character was so well known in the 
  country that he lived in peace and quietness ever after
  and was a great 
  favourite with the ladies
  especially when in process of time
  in 
  the fifth year of her confinement
  my lady rackrent fell ill and took 
  entirely to her bed
  and he gave out that she was now skin and bone
  
  and could not last through the winter
  in this he had two physicians  
  opinions to back him  for now he called in two physicians for her 
  and 
  tried all his arts to get the diamond cross from her on her death bed
  
  and to get her to make a will in his favour of her separate possessions
  
  but there she was too tough for him
  he used to swear at her behind her 
  back after kneeling to her face
  and call her in the presence of his 
  gentleman his stiff necked israelite
  though before he married her that 
  same gentleman told me he used to call her  how he could bring it out
  
  i don t know   my pretty jessica
   to be sure it must have been hard for 
  her to guess what sort of a husband he reckoned to make her
  when she 
  was lying
  to all expectation
  on her death bed of a broken heart
  i 
  could not but pity her
  though she was a jewish
  and considering too it 
  was no fault of hers to be taken with my master
  so young as she was at 
  the bath
  and so fine a gentleman as sir kit was when he courted her
  
  and considering too
  after all they had heard and seen of him as a 
  husband
  there were now no less than three ladies in our county talked 
  of for his second wife
  all at daggers drawn with each other
  as his 
  gentleman swore
  at the balls
  for sir kit for their partner  i could 
  not but think them bewitched
  but they all reasoned with themselves 
  that sir kit would make a good husband to any christian but a jewish
  
  i suppose
  and especially as he was now a reformed rake
  and it was not 
  known how my lady s fortune was settled in her will
  nor how the castle 
  rackrent estate was all mortgaged
  and bonds out against him
  for he was 
  never cured of his gaming tricks
  but that was the only fault he had
  
  god bless him
  
   
  my lady had a sort of fit
  and it was given out that she was dead
  by 
  mistake
  this brought things to a sad crisis for my poor master
  one 
  of the three ladies showed his letters to her brother
  and claimed his 
  promises
  whilst another did the same
  i don t mention names
  sir kit
  
  in his defence
  said he would meet any man who dared to question his 
  conduct
  and as to the ladies
  they must settle it amongst them who was 
  to be his second
  and his third
  and his fourth
  whilst his first was 
  still alive
  to his mortification and theirs
  upon this
  as upon all 
  former occasions
  he had the voice of the country with him
  on account 
  of the great spirit and propriety he acted with
  he met and shot the 
  first lady s brother
  the next day he called out the second
  who had 
  a wooden leg
  and their place of meeting by appointment being in a 
  new ploughed field
  the wooden leg man stuck fast in it
  sir kit
  seeing 
  his situation
  with great candour fired his pistol over his head
  upon 
  which the seconds interposed
  and convinced the parties there had been 
  a slight misunderstanding between them
  thereupon they shook hands 
  cordially
  and went home to dinner together
  this gentleman
  to show the 
  world how they stood together
  and by the advice of the friends of both 
  parties
  to re establish his sister s injured reputation
  went out with 
  sir kit as his second
  and carried his message next day to the last of 
  his adversaries
  i never saw him in such fine spirits as that day he 
  went out  sure enough he was within ames ace of getting quit handsomely 
  of all his enemies
  but unluckily
  after hitting the toothpick out of 
  his adversary s finger and thumb
  he received a ball in a vital part
  
  and was brought home
  in little better than an hour after the affair
  
  speechless on a hand barrow to my lady
  we got the key out of his pocket 
  the first thing we did
  and my son jason ran to unlock the barrack room
  
  where my lady had been shut up for seven years
  to acquaint her with the 
  fatal accident
  the surprise bereaved her of her senses at first
  nor 
  would she believe but we were putting some new trick upon her
  to entrap 
  her out of her jewels
  for a great while
  till jason bethought himself 
  of taking her to the window
  and showed her the men bringing sir kit 
  up the avenue upon the hand barrow
  which had immediately the desired 
  effect
  for directly she burst into tears
  and pulling her cross from 
  her bosom
  she kissed it with as great devotion as ever i witnessed
  
  and lifting up her eyes to heaven
  uttered some ejaculation
  which none 
  present heard
  but i take the sense of it to be
  she returned thanks for 
  this unexpected interposition in her favour when she had least reason to 
  expect it
  my master was greatly lamented
  there was no life in him 
  when we lifted him off the barrow
  so he was laid out immediately
  and 
   waked  the same night
  the country was all in an uproar about him
  and 
  not a soul but cried shame upon his murderer
  who would have been hanged 
  surely
  if he could have been brought to his trial
  whilst the gentlemen 
  in the country were up about it
  but he very prudently withdrew himself 
  to the continent before the affair was made public
  as for the young 
  lady who was the immediate cause of the fatal accident
  however 
  innocently
  she could never show her head after at the balls in the 
  county or any place
  and by the advice of her friends and physicians
  
  she was ordered soon after to bath
  where it was expected
  if anywhere 
  on this side of the grave
  she would meet with the recovery of her 
  health and lost peace of mind
  as a proof of his great popularity
  i 
  need only add that there was a song made upon my master s untimely death 
  in the newspapers
  which was in everybody s mouth
  singing up and down 
  through the country
  even down to the mountains
  only three days after 
  his unhappy exit
  he was also greatly bemoaned at the curragh  see 
  glossary 22 
  where his cattle were well known
  and all who had taken 
  up his bets were particularly inconsolable for his loss to society
  his 
  stud sold at the cant at the greatest price ever known in the county 
   see glossary 23 
  his favourite horses were chiefly disposed of amongst 
  his particular friends
  who would give any price for them for his sake
  
  but no ready money was required by the new heir
  who wished not to 
  displease any of the gentlemen of the neighbourhood just upon his coming 
  to settle amongst them
  so a long credit was given where requisite
  and 
  the cash has never been gathered in from that day to this
  
   
  but to return to my lady
  she got surprisingly well after my master s 
  decease
  no sooner was it known for certain that he was dead
  than all 
  the gentlemen within twenty miles of us came in a body
  as it were
  to 
  set my lady at liberty
  and to protest against her confinement
  which 
  they now for the first time understood was against her own consent
  
  the ladies too were as attentive as possible
  striving who should be 
  foremost with their morning visits
  and they that saw the diamonds spoke 
  very handsomely of them
  but thought it a pity they were not bestowed
  
  if it had so pleased god
  upon a lady who would have become them better
  
  all these civilities wrought little with my lady
  for she had taken an 
  unaccountable prejudice against the country
  and everything belonging to 
  it
  and was so partial to her native land
  that after parting with the 
  cook
  which she did immediately upon my master s decease
  i never knew 
  her easy one instant
  night or day
  but when she was packing up to leave 
  us
  had she meant to make any stay in ireland
  i stood a great chance 
  of being a great favourite with her
  for when she found i understood the 
  weathercock
  she was always finding some pretence to be talking to me
  
  and asking me which way the wind blew
  and was it likely
  did i think
  
  to continue fair for england
  but when i saw she had made up her mind to 
  spend the rest of her days upon her own income and jewels in england
  i 
  considered her quite as a foreigner
  and not at all any longer as part 
  of the family
  she gave no vails to the servants at castle rackrent at 
  parting
  notwithstanding the old proverb of  as rich as a jew
   which 
  she
  being a jewish
  they built upon with reason
  but from first to last 
  she brought nothing but misfortunes amongst us
  and if it had not been 
  all along with her
  his honour
  sir kit
  would have been now alive in 
  all appearance
  her diamond cross was
  they say
  at the bottom of it 
  all
  and it was a shame for her
  being his wife
  not to show more duty
  
  and to have given it up when he condescended to ask so often for such a 
  bit of a trifle in his distresses
  especially when he all along made it 
  no secret he married for money
  but we will not bestow another thought 
  upon her
  this much i thought it lay upon my conscience to say
  in 
  justice to my poor master s memory
  
   
   tis an ill wind that blows nobody no good
  the same wind that took the 
  jew lady rackrent over to england brought over the new heir to castle 
  rackrent
  
   
  here let me pause for breath in my story
  for though i had a great 
  regard for every member of the family
  yet without compare sir conolly
  
  commonly called
  for short
  amongst his friends
  sir condy rackrent
  was 
  ever my great favourite
  and
  indeed
  the most universally beloved man i 
  had ever seen or heard of
  not excepting his great ancestor sir patrick
  
  to whose memory he
  amongst other instances of generosity
  erected a 
  handsome marble stone in the church of castle rackrent
  setting forth 
  in large letters his age
  birth
  parentage
  and many other virtues
  
  concluding with the compliment so justly due
  that  sir patrick rackrent 
  lived and died a monument of old irish hospitality
   
   
   
   
   
  continuation of the memoirs of the rackrent family 
   
   
   
   
  history of sir conolly rackrent 
   
  sir condy rackrent
  by the grace of god heir at law to the castle 
  rackrent estate
  was a remote branch of the family
  born to little or 
  no fortune of his own
  he was bred to the bar
  at which
  having many 
  friends to push him and no mean natural abilities of his own
  he 
  doubtless would in process of time
  if he could have borne the drudgery 
  of that study
  have been rapidly made king s counsel at the least
  but 
  things were disposed of otherwise
  and he never went the circuit but 
  twice
  and then made no figure for want of a fee
  and being unable to 
  speak in public
  he received his education chiefly in the college of 
  dublin
  but before he came to years of discretion lived in the country
  
  in a small but slated house within view of the end of the avenue
  i 
  remember him
  bare footed and headed
  running through the street of 
  o shaughlin s town
  and playing at pitch and toss
  ball
  marbles
  and 
  what not
  with the boys of the town
  amongst whom my son jason was a 
  great favourite with him
  as for me
  he was ever my white headed boy
  
  often s the time
  when i would call in at his father s
  where i was 
  always made welcome
  he would slip down to me in the kitchen
  and
  love 
  to sit on my knee whilst i told him stories of the family and the blood 
  from which he was sprung
  and how he might look forward
  if the then 
  present man should die without childer
  to being at the head of the 
  castle rackrent estate
  this was then spoke quite and clear at random 
  to please the child
  but it pleased heaven to accomplish my prophecy 
  afterwards
  which gave him a great opinion of my judgment in business
  
  he went to a little grammar school with many others
  and my son amongst 
  the rest
  who was in his class
  and not a little useful to him in his 
  book learning
  which he acknowledged with gratitude ever after
  these 
  rudiments of his education thus completed
  he got a horseback
  to which 
  exercise he was ever addicted
  and used to gallop over the country while 
  yet but a slip of a boy
  under the care of sir kit s huntsman
  who 
  was very fond of him
  and often lent him his gun
  and took him out 
  a shooting under his own eye
  by these means he became well acquainted 
  and popular amongst the poor in the neighbourhood early
  for there was 
  not a cabin at which he had not stopped some morning or other
  along 
  with the huntsman
  to drink a glass of burnt whisky out of an eggshell
  
  to do him good and warm his heart and drive the cold out of his stomach
  
  the old people always told him he was a great likeness of sir patrick
  
  which made him first have an ambition to take after him
  as far as his 
  fortune should allow
  he left us when of an age to enter the college
  
  and there completed his education and nineteenth year
  for as he was not 
  born to an estate
  his friends thought it incumbent on them to give him 
  the best education which could be had for love or money
  and a great 
  deal of money consequently was spent upon him at college and temple
  
  he was a very little altered for the worse by what he saw there of the 
  great world
  for when he came down into the country to pay us a visit
  
  we thought him just the same man as ever  hand and glove with every one
  
  and as far from high
  though not without his own proper share of family 
  pride
  as any man ever you see
  latterly
  seeing how sir kit and the 
  jewish lived together
  and that there was no one between him and the 
  castle rackrent estate
  he neglected to apply to the law as much as was 
  expected of him
  and secretly many of the tenants and others advanced 
  him cash upon his note of hand value received
  promising bargains of 
  leases and lawful interest
  should he ever come into the estate
  all 
  this was kept a great secret for fear the present man
  hearing of it
  
  should take it into his head to take it ill of poor condy
  and so should 
  cut him off for ever by levying a fine
  and suffering a recovery to dock 
  the entail  see glossary 24 
  sir murtagh would have been the man for 
  that
  but sir kit was too much taken up philandering to consider the law 
  in this case
  or any other
  these practices i have mentioned to account 
  for the state of his affairs  i mean sir condy s upon his coming into 
  the castle rackrent estate
  he could not command a penny of his first 
  year s income
  which
  and keeping no accounts
  and the great sight of 
  company he did
  with many other causes too numerous to mention
  was the 
  origin of his distresses
  my son jason
  who was now established agent
  
  and knew everything
  explained matters out of the face to sir conolly
  
  and made him sensible of his embarrassed situation
  with a great nominal 
  rent roll
  it was almost all paid away in interest
  which being for 
  convenience suffered to run on
  soon doubled the principal
  and 
  sir condy was obliged to pass new bonds for the interest
  now grown 
  principal
  and so on
  whilst this was going on
  my son requiring to be 
  paid for his trouble and many years  service in the family gratis
  and 
  sir condy not willing to take his affairs into his own hands
  or to look 
  them even in the face
  he gave my son a bargain of some acres which fell 
  out of lease at a reasonable rent
  jason set the land
  as soon as 
  his lease was sealed
  to under tenants
  to make the rent
  and got two 
  hundred a year profit rent
  which was little enough considering his 
  long agency
  he bought the land at twelve years  purchase two years 
  afterwards
  when sir condy was pushed for money on an execution
  and was 
  at the same time allowed for his improvements thereon
  there was a sort 
  of hunting lodge upon the estate
  convenient to my son jason s land
  
  which he had his eye upon about this time
  and he was a little jealous 
  of sir condy
  who talked of setting it to a stranger who was just come 
  into the country  captain moneygawl was the man
  he was son and heir 
  to the moneygawls of mount juliet s town
  who had a great estate in 
  the next county to ours
  and my master was loth to disoblige the young 
  gentleman
  whose heart was set upon the lodge
  so he wrote him back 
  that the lodge was at his service
  and if he would honour him with his 
  company at castle rackrent
  they could ride over together some morning 
  and look at it before signing the lease
  accordingly
  the captain came 
  over to us
  and he and sir condy grew the greatest friends ever you 
  see
  and were for ever out a shooting or hunting together
  and were 
  very merry in the evenings
  and sir condy was invited of course to mount 
  juliet s town
  and the family intimacy that had been in sir patrick s 
  time was now recollected
  and nothing would serve sir condy but he must 
  be three times a week at the least with his new friends
  which grieved 
  me
  who knew
  by the captain s groom and gentleman
  how they talked 
  of him at mount juliet s town
  making him quite
  as one may say
  a 
  laughing stock and a butt for the whole company
  but they were soon 
  cured of that by an accident that surprised  em not a little
  as it did 
  me
  there was a bit of a scrawl found upon the waiting maid of old mr
  
  moneygawl s youngest daughter
  miss isabella
  that laid open the whole
  
  and her father
  they say
  was like one out of his right mind
  and swore 
  it was the last thing he ever should have thought of
  when he invited my 
  master to his house
  that his daughter should think of such a match
  but 
  their talk signified not a straw
  for as miss isabella s maid reported
  
  her young mistress was fallen over head and ears in love with sir condy 
  from the first time that ever her brother brought him into the house to 
  dinner
  the servant who waited that day behind my master s chair was the 
  first who knew it
  as he says
  though it s hard to believe him
  for he 
  did not tell it till a great while afterwards
  but
  however
  it s likely 
  enough
  as the thing turned out
  that he was not far out of the way
  
  for towards the middle of dinner
  as he says
  they were talking of 
  stage plays
  having a playhouse
  and being great play actors at mount 
  juliet s town
  and miss isabella turns short to my master
  and says
  
   
   have you seen the play bill
  sir condy
   
   
   no
  i have not
   said he
  
   
   then more shame for you
   said the captain her brother
   not to know 
  that my sister is to play juliet to night
  who plays it better than any 
  woman on or off the stage in all ireland
   
   
   i am very happy to hear it
   said sir condy
  and there the matter 
  dropped for the present
  
   
  but sir condy all this time
  and a great while afterwards
  was at a 
  terrible nonplus
  for he had no liking
  not he
  to stage plays
  nor 
  to miss isabella either  to his mind
  as it came out over a bowl of 
  whisky punch at home
  his little judy m quirk
  who was daughter to a 
  sister s son of mine
  was worth twenty of miss isabella
  he had seen her 
  often when he stopped at her father s cabin to drink whisky out of the 
  eggshell
  out hunting
  before he came to the estate
  and
  as she gave 
  out
  was under something like a promise of marriage to her
  anyhow
  i 
  could not but pity my poor master
  who was so bothered between them
  and 
  he an easy hearted man
  that could not disoblige nobody  god bless him
  
  to be sure
  it was not his place to behave ungenerous to miss isabella
  
  who had disobliged all her relations for his sake
  as he remarked
  and 
  then she was locked up in her chamber
  and forbid to think of him any 
  more
  which raised his spirit
  because his family was
  as he observed
  
  as good as theirs at any rate
  and the rackrents a suitable match for 
  the moneygawls any day in the year
  all which was true enough
  but it 
  grieved me to see that
  upon the strength of all this
  sir condy was 
  growing more in the mind to carry off miss isabella to scotland
  in 
  spite of her relations
  as she desired
  
   
   it s all over with our poor judy
   said i
  with a heavy sigh
  making 
  bold to speak to him one night when he was a little cheerful
  and 
  standing in the servants  hall all alone with me as was often his 
  custom
  
   
   not at all
   said he
   i never was fonder of judy than at this present 
  speaking
  and to prove it to you
   said he  and he took from my hand 
  a halfpenny change that i had just got along with my tobacco   and to 
  prove it to you
  thady
   says he
   it s a toss up with me which i 
  should marry this minute
  her or mr
  moneygawl of mount juliet s town s 
  daughter  so it is
   
   
  oh boo
  boo
    boo
  boo
   an exclamation equivalent to pshaw or 
  nonsense  says i
  making light of it
  to see what he would go on to 
  next
   your honour s joking
  to be sure
  there s no compare between our 
  poor judy and miss isabella
  who has a great fortune
  they say
   
   
   i m not a man to mind a fortune
  nor never was
   said sir condy
  
  proudly
   whatever her friends may say
  and to make short of it
   says 
  he
   i m come to a determination upon the spot
   with that he swore such 
  a terrible oath as made me cross myself
   and by this book
   said he
  
  snatching up my ballad book
  mistaking it for my prayer book
  which lay 
  in the window
    and by this book
   says he
   and by all the books that 
  ever were shut and opened
  it s come to a toss up with me
  and i ll 
  stand or fall by the toss
  and so thady
  hand me over that pin  pin
  
  read pen
   it formerly was vulgarly pronounced pin in ireland  out of 
  the ink horn
   and he makes a cross on the smooth side of the halfpenny
  
   judy m quirk
   says he
   her mark
   
   
   her mark
   it was the custom in ireland for those who could not write 
  to make a cross to stand for their signature
  as was formerly the 
  practice of our english monarchs
  the editor inserts the facsimile of an 
  irish mark
  which may hereafter be valuable to a judicious antiquary   
   
       her 
       judy x m quirk
  
       mark
  
   
  in bonds or notes signed in this manner a witness is requisite
  as the 
  name is frequently written by him or her
   
   
  god bless him
  his hand was a little unsteadied by all the whisky punch 
  he had taken
  but it was plain to see his heart was for poor judy
  my 
  heart was all as one as in my mouth when i saw the halfpenny up in the 
  air
  but i said nothing at all
  and when it came down i was glad i had 
  kept myself to myself
  for to be sure now it was all over with poor 
  judy
  
   
   judy s out a luck
   said i
  striving to laugh
  
   
   i m out a luck
   said he
  and i never saw a man look so cast down
  he 
  took up the halfpenny off the flag
  and walked away quite sober like 
  by the shock
  now
  though as easy a man
  you would think
  as any in the 
  wide world
  there was no such thing as making him unsay one of these 
  sort of vows
  which he had learned to reverence when young
  as i well 
  remember teaching him to toss up for bog berries on my knee
   vows
   it 
  has been maliciously and unjustly hinted that the lower classes of the 
  people of ireland pay but little regard to oaths
  yet it is certain that 
  some oaths or vows have great power over their minds
  sometimes they 
  swear they will be revenged on some of their neighbours
  this is an 
  oath that they are never known to break
  but
  what is infinitely more 
  extraordinary and unaccountable
  they sometimes make and keep a vow 
  against whisky
  these vows are usually limited to a short time
  a woman 
  who has a drunken husband is most fortunate if she can prevail upon 
  him to go to the priest
  and make a vow against whisky for a year
  or a 
  month
  or a week
  or a day
   so i saw the affair was as good as settled 
  between him and miss isabella
  and i had no more to say but to wish her 
  joy
  which i did the week afterwards
  upon her return from scotland with 
  my poor master
  
   
  my new lady was young
  as might be supposed of a lady that had been 
  carried off by her own consent to scotland
  but i could only see her 
  at first through her veil
  which
  from bashfulness or fashion
  she kept 
  over her face
  
   
   and am i to walk through all this crowd of people
  my dearest love
   
  said she to sir condy
  meaning us servants and tenants
  who had gathered 
  at the back gate
  
   
   my dear
   said sir condy
   there s nothing for it but to walk
  or to 
  let me carry you as far as the house
  for you see the back road is too 
  narrow for a carriage
  and the great piers have tumbled down across the 
  front approach
  so there s no driving the right way
  by reason of the 
  ruins
   
   
   plato
  thou reasonest well
   said she
  or words to that effect
  which 
  i could noways understand
  and again
  when her foot stumbled against a 
  broken bit of a car wheel
  she cried out
   angels and ministers of grace 
  defend us
   well
  thought i
  to be sure
  if she s no jewish
  like the 
  last
  she is a mad woman for certain
  which is as bad
  it would have 
  been as well for my poor master to have taken up with poor judy
  who is 
  in her right mind anyhow
  
   
  she was dressed like a mad woman
  moreover
  more than like any one i 
  ever saw afore or since
  and i could not take my eyes off her
  but still 
  followed behind her
  and her feathers on the top of her hat were broke 
  going in at the low back door and she pulled out her little bottle out 
  of her pocket to smell when she found herself in the kitchen
  and said
  
   i shall faint with the heat of this odious
  odious place
   
   
   my dear
  it s only three steps across the kitchen
  and there s a fine 
  air if your veil was up
   said sir condy
  and with that threw back her 
  veil
  so that i had then a full sight of her face
  she had not at all 
  the colour of one going to faint
  but a fine complexion of her own
  as i 
  then took it to be
  though her maid told me after it was all put on
  
  but even
  complexion and all taken in
  she was no way
  in point of good 
  looks
  to compare to poor judy
  and withal she had a quality toss with 
  her
  but maybe it was my over partiality to judy
  into whose place i may 
  say she stepped
  that made me notice all this
  
   
  to do her justice
  however
  she was
  when we came to know her better
  
  very liberal in her housekeeping  nothing at all of the skinflint in 
  her
  she left everything to the housekeeper
  and her own maid
  mrs
  
  jane
  who went with her to scotland
  gave her the best of characters 
  for generosity
  she seldom or ever wore a thing twice the same way
  mrs
  
  jane told us
  and was always pulling her things to pieces and giving 
  them away
  never being used
  in her father s house
  to think of expense 
  in anything
  and she reckoned to be sure to go on the same way at castle 
  rackrent
  but when i came to inquire
  i learned that her father was so 
  mad with her for running off
  after his locking her up and forbidding 
  her to think any more of sir condy
  that he would not give her a 
  farthing
  and it was lucky for her she had a few thousands of her own
  
  which had been left to her by a good grandmother
  and these were very 
  convenient to begin with
  my master and my lady set out in great style
  
  they had the finest coach and chariot
  and horses and liveries
  and cut 
  the greatest dash in the county
  returning their wedding visits
  and it 
  was immediately reported that her father had undertaken to pay all my 
  master s debts
  and of course all his tradesmen gave him a new credit
  
  and everything went on smack smooth
  and i could not but admire my 
  lady s spirit
  and was proud to see castle rackrent again in all 
  its glory
  my lady had a fine taste for building
  and furniture
  
  and playhouses
  and she turned everything topsy turvy
  and made the 
  barrack room into a theatre
  as she called it
  and she went on as if 
  she had a mint of money at her elbow
  and to be sure i thought she knew 
  best
  especially as sir condy said nothing to it one way or the other
  
  all he asked  god bless him
   was to live in peace and quietness
  and 
  have his bottle or his whisky punch at night to himself
  now this was 
  little enough
  to be sure
  for any gentleman
  but my lady couldn t abide 
  the smell of the whisky punch
  
   
   my dear
   says he
   you liked it well enough before we were married
  
  and why not now
   
   
   my dear
   said she
   i never smelt it
  or i assure you i should never 
  have prevailed upon myself to marry you
   
   
   my dear
  i am sorry you did not smell it
  but we can t help that now
   
  returned my master
  without putting himself in a passion
  or going out 
  of his way
  but just fair and easy helped himself to another glass
  and 
  drank it off to her good health
  
   
  all this the butler told me
  who was going backwards and forwards 
  unnoticed with the jug
  and hot water
  and sugar
  and all he thought 
  wanting
  upon my master s swallowing the last glass of whisky punch 
  my lady burst into tears
  calling him an ungrateful
  base
  barbarous 
  wretch
  and went off into a fit of hysterics
  as i think mrs
  jane 
  called it
  and my poor master was greatly frightened
  this being the 
  first thing of the kind he had seen
  and he fell straight on his knees 
  before her
  and
  like a good hearted cratur as he was
  ordered the 
  whisky punch out of the room
  and bid  em throw open all the windows
  
  and cursed himself
  and then my lady came to herself again
  and when 
  she saw him kneeling there
  bid him get up
  and not forswear himself any 
  more
  for that she was sure he did not love her
  and never had
  this 
  we learned from mrs
  jane
  who was the only person left present at all 
  this
  
   
   my dear
   returns my master
  thinking
  to be sure
  of judy
  as well he 
  might
   whoever told you so is an incendiary
  and i ll have  em turned 
  out of the house this minute
  if you ll only let me know which of them 
  it was
   
   
   told me what
   said my lady
  starting upright in her chair
  
   
   nothing at all
  nothing at all
   said my master
  seeing he had overshot 
  himself
  and that my lady spoke at random
   but what you said just now
  
  that i did not love you
  bella
  who told you that
   
   
   my own sense
   she said
  and she put her handkerchief to her face
  and 
  leant back upon mrs
  jane
  and fell to sobbing as if her heart would 
  break
  
   
   why now
  bella
  this is very strange of you
   said my poor master
   if 
  nobody has told you nothing
  what is it you are taking on for at this 
  rate
  and exposing yourself and me for this way
   
   
   oh
  say no more
  say no more
  every word you say kills me
   cried 
  my lady
  and she ran on like one
  as mrs
  jane says
  raving
   oh
  sir 
  condy
  sir condy
  i that had hoped to find in you    
   
   why now
  faith
  this is a little too much
  do
  bella
  try to recollect 
  yourself
  my dear
  am not i your husband
  and of your own choosing
  and 
  is not that enough
   
   
   oh
  too much
  too much
   cried my lady
  wringing her hands
  
   
   why
  my dear
  come to your right senses
  for the love of heaven
  see
  
  is not the whisky punch
  jug and bowl and all
  gone out of the room long 
  ago
  what is it
  in the wide world
  you have to complain of
   
   
  but still my lady sobbed and sobbed
  and called herself the most 
  wretched of women
  and among other out of the way provoking things
  
  asked my master
  was he fit company for her
  and he drinking all night
  
  this nettling him
  which it was hard to do
  he replied
  that as to 
  drinking all night
  he was then as sober as she was herself
  and that 
  it was no matter how much a man drank
  provided it did noways affect or 
  stagger him
  that as to being fit company for her
  he thought himself of 
  a family to be fit company for any lord or lady in the land
  but that 
  he never prevented her from seeing and keeping what company she pleased
  
  and that he had done his best to make castle rackrent pleasing to her 
  since her marriage
  having always had the house full of visitors
  and 
  if her own relations were not amongst them
  he said that was their 
  own fault
  and their pride s fault
  of which he was sorry to find her 
  ladyship had so unbecoming a share
  so concluding
  he took his candle 
  and walked off to his room
  and my lady was in her tantarums for three 
  days after
  and would have been so much longer
  no doubt
  but some of 
  her friends
  young ladies
  and cousins
  and second cousins
  came to 
  castle rackrent
  by my poor master s express invitation
  to see her
  and 
  she was in a hurry to get up
  as mrs
  jane called it
  a play for them
  
  and so got well
  and was as finely dressed
  and as happy to look at
  as 
  ever
  and all the young ladies
  who used to be in her room dressing of 
  her
  said in mrs
  jane s hearing that my lady was the happiest bride 
  ever they had seen
  and that to be sure a love match was the only thing 
  for happiness
  where the parties could any way afford it
  
   
  as to affording it
  god knows it was little they knew of the matter
  
  my lady s few thousands could not last for ever
  especially the way she 
  went on with them
  and letters from tradesfolk came every post thick and 
  threefold
  with bills as long as my arm
  of years  and years  standing
  
  my son jason had  em all handed over to him
  and the pressing letters 
  were all unread by sir condy
  who hated trouble
  and could never be 
  brought to hear talk of business
  but still put it off and put it off
  
  saying
   settle it anyhow
   or
   bid  em call again to morrow
   or
  
   speak to me about it some other time
   now it was hard to find the 
  right time to speak
  for in the mornings he was a bed
  and in the 
  evenings over his bottle
  where no gentleman chooses to be disturbed
  
  things in a twelvemonth or so came to such a pass there was no making a 
  shift to go on any longer
  though we were all of us well enough used to 
  live from hand to mouth at castle rackrent
  one day
  i remember
  when 
  there was a power of company
  all sitting after dinner in the dusk
  not 
  to say dark
  in the drawing room
  my lady having rung five times for 
  candles
  and none to go up
  the housekeeper sent up the footman
  who 
  went to my mistress
  and whispered behind her chair how it was
  
   
   my lady
   says he
   there are no candles in the house
   
   
   bless me
   says she
   then take a horse and gallop off as fast as you 
  can to carrick o fungus
  and get some
   
   
   and in the meantime tell them to step into the playhouse
  and try if 
  there are not some bits left
   added sir condy
  who happened
  to be 
  within hearing
  the man was sent up again to my lady
  to let her know 
  there was no horse to go
  but one that wanted a shoe
  
   
   go to sir condy then
  i know nothing at all about the horses
   said 
  my lady
   why do you plague me with these things
   how it was settled i 
  really forget
  but to the best of my remembrance
  the boy was sent down 
  to my son jason s to borrow candles for the night
  another time
  in 
  the winter
  and on a desperate cold day
  there was no turf in for the 
  parlour and above stairs
  and scarce enough for the cook in the kitchen
  
  the little gossoon was sent off to the neighbours
  to see and beg or 
  borrow some
  but none could he bring back with him for love or money
  
   gossoon
  a little boy  from the french word garcon
  in most irish 
  families there used to be a barefooted gossoon
  who was slave to the 
  cook and the butler
  and who
  in fact
  without wages
  did all the hard 
  work of the house
  gossoons were always employed as messengers
  the 
  editor has known a gossoon to go on foot
  without shoes or stockings
  
  fifty one english miles between sunrise and sunset
   so
  as needs must
  
  we were forced to trouble sir condy   well
  and if there s no turf to be 
  had in the town or country
  why
  what signifies talking any more about 
  it
  can t ye go and cut down a tree
   
   
   which tree
  please your honour
   i made bold to say
  
   
   any tree at all that s good to burn
   said sir condy
   send off smart 
  and get one down
  and the fires lighted
  before my lady gets up to 
  breakfast
  or the house will be too hot to hold us
   
   
  he was always very considerate in all things about my lady
  and she 
  wanted for nothing whilst he had it to give
  well
  when things were 
  tight with them about this time
  my son jason put in a word again about 
  the lodge
  and made a genteel offer to lay down the purchase money
  
  to relieve sir condy s distresses
  now sir condy had it from the best 
  authority that there were two writs come down to the sheriff against 
  his person
  and the sheriff
  as ill luck would have it
  was no friend of 
  his
  and talked how he must do his duty
  and how he would do it
  if it 
  was against the first man in the country
  or even his own brother
  let 
  alone one who had voted against him at the last election
  as sir condy 
  had done
  so sir condy was fain to take the purchase money of the lodge 
  from my son jason to settle matters
  and sure enough it was a good 
  bargain for both parties
  for my son bought the fee simple of a good 
  house for him and his heirs for ever
  for little or nothing
  and by 
  selling of it for that same my master saved himself from a gaol
  every 
  way it turned out fortunate for sir condy
  for before the money was all 
  gone there came a general election
  and he being so well beloved in the 
  county
  and one of the oldest families
  no one had a better right to 
  stand candidate for the vacancy
  and he was called upon by all his 
  friends
  and the whole county i may say
  to declare himself against 
  the old member
  who had little thought of a contest
  my master did not 
  relish the thoughts of a troublesome canvass
  and all the ill will he 
  might bring upon himself by disturbing the peace of the county
  besides 
  the expense
  which was no trifle
  but all his friends called upon one 
  another to subscribe
  and they formed themselves into a committee
  and 
  wrote all his circular letters for him
  and engaged all his agents
  and 
  did all the business unknown to him
  and he was well pleased that it 
  should be so at last
  and my lady herself was very sanguine about 
  the election
  and there was open house kept night and day at castle 
  rackrent
  and i thought i never saw my lady look so well in her life as 
  she did at that time
  there were grand dinners
  and all the gentlemen 
  drinking success to sir condy till they were carried off
  and then 
  dances and balls
  and the ladies all finishing with a raking pot of tea 
  in the morning  see glossary 25 
  indeed
  it was well the company made 
  it their choice to sit up all nights
  for there were not half beds 
  enough for the sights of people that were in it
  though there were 
  shake downs in the drawing room always made up before sunrise for those 
  that liked it
  for my part
  when i saw the doings that were going on
  
  and the loads of claret that went down the throats of them that had no 
  right to be asking for it
  and the sights of meat that went up to table 
  and never came down
  besides what was carried off to one or t other 
  below stair
  i couldn t but pity my poor master
  who was to pay for 
  all
  but i said nothing
  for fear of gaining myself ill will
  the day of 
  election will come some time or other
  says i to myself
  and all will 
  be over
  and so it did
  and a glorious day it was as any i ever had the 
  happiness to see
  
   
   huzza
  huzza
  sir condy rackrent for ever
   was the first thing i hears 
  in the morning
  and the same and nothing else all day
  and not a soul 
  sober only just when polling
  enough to give their votes as became  em
  
  and to stand the browbeating of the lawyers
  who came tight enough 
  upon us
  and many of our freeholders were knocked off
  having never a 
  freehold that they could safely swear to
  and sir condy was not willing 
  to have any man perjure himself for his sake
  as was done on the other 
  side
  god knows
  but no matter for that
  some of our friends were 
  dumbfounded by the lawyers asking them
  had they ever been upon the 
  ground where their freeholds lay
  now
  sir condy being tender of the 
  consciences of them that had not been on the ground
  and so could not 
  swear to a freehold when cross examined by them lawyers
  sent out for a 
  couple of cleavesful of the sods of his farm of gulteeshinnagh
   at st
  
  patrick s meeting
  london
  march 1806
  the duke of sussex said he had 
  the honour of bearing an irish title
  and
  with the permission of the 
  company
  he should tell them an anecdote of what he had experienced on 
  his travels
  when he was at rome he went to visit an irish seminary
  and 
  when they heard who it was
  and that he had an irish title
  some of them 
  asked him
   please your royal highness
  since you are an irish peer
  
  will you tell us if you ever trod upon irish ground
   when he told them 
  he had not
   oh
  then
   said one of the order
   you shall soon do so
   
  they then spread some earth
  which had been brought from ireland
  on a 
  marble slab
  and made him stand upon it
   and as soon as the sods came 
  into town
  he set each man upon his sod
  and so then
  ever after
  you 
  know
  they could fairly swear they had been upon the ground
   this was 
  actually done at an election in ireland
   we gained the day by this 
  piece of honesty  see glossary 26 
  i thought i should have died in the 
  streets for joy when i seed my poor master chaired
  and he bareheaded
  
  and it raining as hard as it could pour
  but all the crowds following 
  him up and down
  and he bowing and shaking hands with the whole town
  
   
   is that sir condy rackrent in the chair
   says a stranger man in the 
  crowd
  
   
   the same
   says i
   who else should it be
  god bless him
   
   
   and i take it
  then
  you belong to him
   says he
  
   
   not at all
   says i
   but i live under him
  and have done so these two 
  hundred years and upwards
  me and mine
   
   
   it s lucky for you
  then
   rejoins he
   that he is where he is
  for was 
  he anywhere else but in the chair
  this minute he d be in a worse place
  
  for i was sent down on purpose to put him up
   to put him up
  to put him 
  in gaol  and here s my order for so doing in my pocket
   
   
  it was a writ that villain the wine merchant had marked against my poor 
  master for some hundreds of an old debt
  which it was a shame to be 
  talking of at such a time as this
  
   
   put it in your pocket again
  and think no more of it anyways for seven 
  years to come
  my honest friend
   says i
   he s a member of parliament 
  now
  praised be god
  and such as you can t touch him
  and if you ll take 
  a fool s advice
  i d have you keep out of the way this day
  or you ll 
  run a good chance of getting your deserts amongst my master s friends
  
  unless you choose to drink his health like everybody else
   
   
   i ve no objection to that in life
   said he
  so we went into one of the 
  public houses kept open for my master
  and we had a great deal of talk 
  about this thing and that
   and how is it
   says he
   your master keeps 
  on so well upon his legs
  i heard say he was off holantide twelvemonth 
  past
   
   
   never was better or heartier in his life
   said i
  
   
   it s not that i m after speaking of  said he
   but there was a great 
  report of his being ruined
   
   
   no matter
   says i
   the sheriffs two years running were his particular 
  friends
  and the sub sheriffs were both of them gentlemen
  and were 
  properly spoken to
  and so the writs lay snug with them
  and they
  as 
  i understand by my son jason the custom in them cases is
  returned the 
  writs as they came to them to those that sent  em much good may it do 
  them
   with a word in latin
  that no such person as sir condy rackrent
  
  bart
 
  was to be found in those parts
   
   
   oh
  i understand all those ways better  no offence  than you
   says 
  he
  laughing
  and at the same time filling his glass to my master s good 
  health
  which convinced me he was a warm friend in his heart after 
  all
  though appearances were a little suspicious or so at first
   to 
  be sure
   says he
  still cutting his joke
   when a man s over head and 
  shoulders in debt
  he may live the faster for it
  and the better if he 
  goes the right way about it
  or else how is it so many live on so well
  
  as we see every day
  after they are ruined
   
   
   how is it
   says i
  being a little merry at the time   how is it but 
  just as you see the ducks in the chicken yard
  just after their heads 
  are cut off by the cook
  running round and round faster than when 
  alive
   
   
  at which conceit he fell a laughing
  and remarked he had never had the 
  happiness yet to see the chicken yard at castle rackrent
  
   
   it won t be long so
  i hope
   says i
   you ll be kindly welcome 
  there
  as everybody is made by my master
  there is not a freer spoken 
  gentleman
  or a better beloved
  high or low
  in all ireland
   
   
  and of what passed after this i m not sensible
  for we drank sir candy s 
  good health and the downfall of his enemies till we could stand no 
  longer ourselves
  and little did i think at the time
  or till long 
  after
  how i was harbouring my poor master s greatest of enemies myself
  
  this fellow had the impudence
  after coming to see the chicken yard
  to 
  get me to introduce him to my son jason
  little more than the man that 
  never was born did i guess at his meaning by this visit
  he gets him 
  a correct list fairly drawn out from my son jason of all my master s 
  debts
  and goes straight round to the creditors and buys them all up
  
  which he did easy enough
  seeing the half of them never expected to see 
  their money out of sir condy s hands
  then
  when this base minded limb 
  of the law
  as i afterwards detected him in being
  grew to be sole 
  creditor over all
  he takes him out a custodiam on all the denominations 
  and sub denominations
  and even carton and half carton upon the estate 
   see glossary 27 
  and not content with that
  must have an execution 
  against the master s goods and down to the furniture
  though little 
  worth
  of castle rackrent itself
  but this is a part of my story i m not 
  come to yet
  and it s bad to be forestalling
  ill news flies fast enough 
  all the world over
  
   
  to go back to the day of the election
  which i never think of but with 
  pleasure and tears of gratitude for those good times
  after the election 
  was quite and clean over
  there comes shoals of people from all parts
  
  claiming to have obliged my master with their votes
  and putting him in 
  mind of promises which he could never remember himself to have made
  one 
  was to have a freehold for each of his four sons
  another was to have 
  a renewal of a lease
  another an abatement
  one came to be paid ten 
  guineas for a pair of silver buckles sold my master on the hustings
  
  which turned out to be no better than copper gilt
  another had a long 
  bill for oats
  the half of which never went into the granary to my 
  certain knowledge
  and the other half was not fit for the cattle to 
  touch
  but the bargain was made the week before the election
  and the 
  coach and saddle horses were got into order for the day
  besides a vote 
  fairly got by them oats
  so no more reasoning on that head
  but then 
  there was no end to them that were telling sir condy he had engaged to 
  make their sons excisemen
  or high constables
  or the like
  and as for 
  them that had bills to give in for liquor
  and beds
  and straw
  and 
  ribands
  and horses
  and post chaises for the gentlemen freeholders that 
  came from all parts and other counties to vote for my master
  and were 
  not
  to be sure
  to be at any charges
  there was no standing against all 
  these
  and
  worse than all
  the gentlemen of my master s committee
  who 
  managed all for him
  and talked how they d bring him in without costing 
  him a penny
  and subscribed by hundreds very genteelly
  forgot to pay 
  their subscriptions
  and had laid out in agents  and lawyers  fees and 
  secret service money to the lord knows how much
  and my master could 
  never ask one of them for their subscription you are sensible
  nor for 
  the price of a fine horse he had sold one of them
  so it all was left at 
  his door
  he could never
  god bless him again
  i say
  bring himself to 
  ask a gentleman for money
  despising such sort of conversation himself
  
  but others
  who were not gentlemen born
  behaved very uncivil in 
  pressing him at this very time
  and all he could do to content  em all 
  was to take himself out of the way as fast as possible to dublin
  where 
  my lady had taken a house fitting for him as a member of parliament
  
  to attend his duty in there all the winter
  i was very lonely when the 
  whole family was gone
  and all the things they had ordered to go
  and 
  forgot
  sent after them by the car
  there was then a great silence in 
  castle rackrent
  and i went moping from room to room
  hearing the doors 
  clap for want of right locks
  and the wind through the broken windows
  
  that the glazier never would come to mend
  and the rain coming through 
  the roof and best ceilings all over the house for want of the slater
  
  whose bill was not paid
  besides our having no slates or shingles for 
  that part of the old building which was shingled and burnt when the 
  chimney took fire
  and had been open to the weather ever since
  i took 
  myself to the servants  hall in the evening to smoke my pipe as usual
  
  but missed the bit of talk we used to have there sadly
  and ever after 
  was content to stay in the kitchen and boil my little potatoes
   my 
  little potatoes
   thady does not mean by this expression that his 
  potatoes were less than other people s
  or less than the usual size
  
  little is here used only as an italian diminutive
  expressive of 
  fondness
   and put up my bed there
  and every post day i looked in the 
  newspaper
  but no news of my master in the house
  he never spoke good 
  or bad
  but
  as the butler wrote down word to my son jason
  was very 
  ill used by the government about a place that was promised him and never 
  given
  after his supporting them against his conscience very honourably
  
  and being greatly abused for it
  which hurt him greatly
  he having the 
  name of a great patriot in the country before
  the house and living in 
  dublin too were not to be had for nothing
  and my son jason said
   sir 
  condy must soon be looking out for a new agent
  for i ve done my part
  
  and can do no more
  if my lady had the bank of ireland to spend
  it 
  would go all in one winter
  and sir condy would never gainsay her
  
  though he does not care the rind of a lemon for her all the while
   
   
  now i could not bear to hear jason giving out after this manner against 
  the family
  and twenty people standing by in the street
  ever since he 
  had lived at the lodge of his own he looked down
  howsomever
  upon poor 
  old thady
  and was grown quite a great gentleman
  and had none of his 
  relations near him
  no wonder he was no kinder to poor sir condy than to 
  his own kith or kin
   kith and kin
  family or relations
  kin from kind
  
  kith from we know not what
   in the spring it was the villain that got 
  the list of the debts from him brought down the custodiam
  sir condy 
  still attending his duty in parliament and i could scarcely believe my 
  own old eyes
  or the spectacles with which i read it
  when i was shown 
  my son jason s name joined in the custodiam
  but he told me it was only 
  for form s sake
  and to make things easier than if all the land was 
  under the power of a total stranger
  well
  i did not know what to think
  
  it was hard to be talking ill of my own
  and i could not but grieve for 
  my poor master s fine estate
  all torn by these vultures of the law
  so 
  i said nothing
  but just looked on to see how it would all end
  
   
  it was not till the month of june that he and my lady came down to 
  the country
  my master was pleased to take me aside with him to the 
  brewhouse that same evening
  to complain to me of my son and other 
  matters
  in which he said he was confident i had neither art nor part
  
  he said a great deal more to me
  to whom he had been fond to talk ever 
  since he was my white headed boy before he came to the estate
  and all 
  that he said about poor judy i can never forget
  but scorn to repeat
  he 
  did not say an unkind word of my lady
  but wondered
  as well he might
  
  her relations would do nothing for him or her
  and they in all this 
  great distress
  he did not take anything long to heart
  let it be as it 
  would
  and had no more malice or thought of the like in him than a child 
  that can t speak
  this night it was all out of his head before he went 
  to his bed
  he took his jug of whisky punch  my lady was grown quite 
  easy about the whisky punch by this time
  and so i did suppose all was 
  going on right betwixt them till i learnt the truth through mrs
  jane
  
  who talked over the affairs to the housekeeper
  and i within hearing
  
  the night my master came home
  thinking of nothing at all but just 
  making merry
  he drank his bumper toast  to the deserts of that old 
  curmudgeon my father in law
  and all enemies at mount juliet s town
   
  now my lady was no longer in the mind she formerly was
  and did noways 
  relish hearing her own friends abused in her presence
  she said
  
   
   then why don t they show themselves your friends  said my master
   and 
  oblige me with the loan of the money i condescended
  by your advice
  my 
  dear
  to ask
  it s now three posts since i sent off my letter
  desiring 
  in the postscript a speedy answer by the return of the post
  and no 
  account at all from them yet
   
   
   i expect they ll write to me next post
   says my lady
  and that was 
  all that passed then
  but it was easy from this to guess there was a 
  coolness betwixt them
  and with good cause
  
   
  the next morning
  being post day
  i sent off the gossoon early to 
  the post office
  to see was there any letter likely to set matters to 
  rights
  and he brought back one with the proper postmark upon it
  sure 
  enough
  and i had no time to examine or make any conjecture more about 
  it
  for into the servants  hall pops mrs
  jane with a blue bandbox in 
  her hand
  quite entirely mad
  
   
   dear ma am
  and what s the matter
   says i
  
   
   matter enough
   says she
   don t you see my bandbox is wet through
  
  and my best bonnet here spoiled
  besides my lady s
  and all by the rain 
  coming in through that gallery window that you might have got mended if 
  you d had any sense
  thady
  all the time we were in town in the winter
   
   
   sure
  i could not get the glazier
  ma am
   says i
  
   
   you might have stopped it up anyhow
   says she
  
   
   so i
  did
  ma am
  to the best of my ability
  one of the panes with 
  the old pillow case
  and the other with a piece of the old stage green 
  curtain
  sure i was as careful as possible all the time you were away
  
  and not a drop of rain came in at that window of all the windows in the 
  house
  all winter
  ma am
  when under my care
  and now the family s come 
  home
  and it s summer time
  i never thought no more about it
  to be 
  sure
  but dear
  it s a pity to think of your bonnet
  ma am
  but here s 
  what will please you
  ma am  a letter from mount juliet s town for my 
  lady
  
   
  with that she snatches it from me without a word more
  and runs up 
  the back stairs to my mistress
  i follows with a slate to make up the 
  window
  this window was in the long passage
  or gallery
  as my lady 
  gave out orders to have it called
  in the gallery leading to my master s 
  bedchamber and hers
  and when i went up with the slate
  the door having 
  no lock
  and the bolt spoilt
  was ajar after mrs
  jane
  and
  as i was 
  busy with the window
  i heard all that was saying within
  
   
   well
  what s in your letter
  bella
  my dear
   says he
   you re a long 
  time spelling it over
   
   
   won t you shave this morning
  sir condy
   says she
  and put the letter 
  into her pocket
  
   
   i shaved the day before yesterday
   said he
   my dear
  and that s not 
  what i m thinking of now
  but anything to oblige you
  and to have peace 
  and quietness
  my dear   and presently i had a glimpse of him at the 
  cracked glass over the chimney piece
  standing up shaving himself to 
  please my lady
  but she took no notice
  but went on reading her book
  
  and mrs
  jane doing her hair behind
  
   
   what is it you re reading there
  my dear
   phoo
  i ve cut myself with 
  this razor
  the man s a cheat that sold it me
  but i have not paid him 
  for it yet
  what is it you re reading there
  did you hear me asking you
  
  my dear
   
   
   the sorrows of werther
   replies my lady
  as well as i could hear
  
   
   i think more of the sorrows of sir condy
   says my master
  joking like
  
   what news from mount juliet s town
   
   
   no news
   says she
   but the old story over again
  my friends all 
  reproaching me still for what i can t help now
   
   
   is it for marrying me
   said my master
  still shaving
   what signifies
  
  as you say
  talking of that
  when it can t be help d now
   
   
  with that she heaved a great sigh that i heard plain enough in the 
  passage
  
   
   and did not you use me basely
  sir condy
   says she
   not to tell me 
  you were ruined before i married you
   
   
   tell you
  my dear
   said he
   did you ever ask me one word about it
  
  and had not your friends enough of your own
  that were telling you 
  nothing else from morning to night
  if you d have listened to them 
  slanders
   
   
   no slanders
  nor are my friends slanderers
  and i can t bear to hear 
  them treated with disrespect as i do
   says my lady
  and took out her 
  pocket handkerchief
   they are the best of friends
  and if i had taken 
  their advice  but my father was wrong to lock me up
  i own
  that was the 
  only unkind thing i can charge him with
  for if he had not locked me up
  
  i should never have had a serious thought of running away as i did
   
   
   well
  my dear
   said my master
   don t cry and make yourself uneasy 
  about it now
  when it s all over
  and you have the man of your own 
  choice
  in spite of  em all
   
   
   i was too young
  i know
  to make a choice at the time you ran away with 
  me
  i m sure
   says my lady
  and another sigh
  which made my master
  
  half shaved as he was
  turn round upon her in surprise
  
   
   why
  bell
   says he
   you can t deny what you know as well as i do
  
  that it was at your own particular desire
  and that twice under your 
  own hand and seal expressed
  that i should carry you off as i did to 
  scotland
  and marry you there
   
   
   well
  say no more about it
  sir condy
   said my lady
  pettish like
   i 
  was a child then
  you know
   
   
   and as far as i know
  you re little better now
  my dear bella
  to be 
  talking in this manner to your husband s face
  but i won t take it 
  ill of you
  for i know it s something in that letter you put into your 
  pocket just now that has set you against me all on a sudden
  and imposed 
  upon your understanding
   
   
   it s not so very easy as you think it
  sir condy
  to impose upon my 
  understanding
   said my lady
  
   
   my dear
   says he
   i have
  and with reason
  the best opinion of your 
  understanding of any man now breathing
  and you know i have never set my 
  own in competition with it till now
  my dear bella
   says he
  taking her 
  hand from her book as kind as could be   till now
  when i have the great 
  advantage of being quite cool
  and you not
  so don t believe one word 
  your friends say against your own sir condy
  and lend me the letter out 
  of your pocket
  till i see what it is they can have to say
   
   
   take it then
   says she
   and as you are quite cool
  i hope it is a 
  proper time to request you ll allow me to comply with the wishes of all 
  my own friends
  and return to live with my father and family
  during the 
  remainder of my wretched existence
  at mount juliet s town
   
   
  at this my poor master fell back a few paces
  like one that had been 
  shot
  
   
   you re not serious
  bella
   says he
   and could you find it in your 
  heart to leave me this way in the very middle of my distresses
  all 
  alone
   but recollecting himself after his first surprise
  and a moment s 
  time for reflection
  he said
  with a great deal of consideration for my 
  lady
   well
  bella
  my dear
  i believe you are right
  for what could you 
  do at castle rackrent
  and an execution against the goods coming down
  
  and the furniture to be canted
  and an auction in the house all next 
  week
  so you have my full consent to go
  since that is your desire
  only 
  you must not think of my accompanying you
  which i could not in honour 
  do upon the terms i always have been
  since our marriage
  with your 
  friends
  besides
  i have business to transact at home
  so in the 
  meantime
  if we are to have any breakfast this morning
  let us go down 
  and have it for the last time in peace and comfort
  bella
   
   
  then as i heard my master coming to the passage door
  i finished 
  fastening up my slate against the broken pane
  and when he came out i 
  wiped down the window seat with my wig
  i and bade him a  good morrow  
  as kindly as i could
  seeing he was in trouble
  though he strove and 
  thought to hide it from me
  
   
   wigs were formerly used instead of brooms in ireland for sweeping or 
  dusting tables
  stairs
  etc
  the editor doubted the fact till he saw a 
  labourer of the old school sweep down a flight of stairs with his wig
  
  he afterwards put it on his head again with the utmost composure
  and 
  said
   oh
  please your honour
  it s never a bit the worse
  
   
  it must be acknowledged that these men are not in any danger of catching 
  cold by taking off their wigs occasionally
  because they usually have 
  fine crops of hair growing under their wigs
  the wigs are often yellow
  
  and the hair which appears from beneath them black
  the wigs are usually 
  too small
  and are raised up by the hair beneath
  or by the ears of the 
  wearers
   
   
   this window is all racked and tattered
   says i
   and it s what i m 
  striving to mend
   
   
   it is all racked and tattered
  plain enough
   says he
   and never mind 
  mending it
  honest old thady
   says he
   it will do well enough for you 
  and i
  and that s all the company we shall have left in the house by and 
  by
   
   
   i m sorry to see your honour so low this morning
   says i
   but you ll 
  be better after taking your breakfast
   
   
   step down to the servants  hall
   said he
   and bring me up the pen 
  and ink into the parlour
  and get a sheet of paper from mrs
  jane
  for i 
  have business that can t brook to be delayed
  and come into the parlour 
  with the pen and ink yourself
  thady
  for i must have you to witness my 
  signing a paper i have to execute in a hurry
   
   
  well
  while i was getting of the pen and ink horn
  and the sheet of 
  paper
  i ransacked my brains to think what could be the papers my poor 
  master could have to execute in such a hurry
  he that never thought of 
  such a thing as doing business afore breakfast in the whole course of 
  his life
  for any man living
  but this was for my lady
  as i afterwards 
  found
  and the more genteel of him after all her treatment
  
   
  i was just witnessing the paper that he had scrawled over
  and was 
  shaking the ink out of my pen upon the carpet
  when my lady came in to 
  breakfast
  and she started as if it had been a ghost
  as well she might
  
  when she saw sir condy writing at this unseasonable hour
  
   
   that will do very well
  thady
   says he to me
  and took the paper i had 
  signed to
  without knowing what upon the earth it might be
  out of my 
  hands
  and walked
  folding it up
  to my lady
  
   
   you are concerned in this
  my lady rackrent
   said he
  putting it into 
  her hands
   and i beg you ll keep this memorandum safe
  and show it to 
  your friends the first thing you do when you get home
  but put it in 
  your pocket now
  my dear
  and let us eat our breakfast
  in god s name
   
   
   what is all this
   said my lady
  opening the paper in great curiosity
  
   
   it s only a bit of a memorandum of what i think becomes me to do 
  whenever i am able
   says my master
   you know my situation
  tied hand 
  and foot at the present time being
  but that can t last always
  and when 
  i m dead and gone the land will be to the good
  thady
  you know
  and 
  take notice it s my intention your lady should have a clear five hundred 
  a year jointure out the estate afore any of my debts are paid
    oh
  
  please your honour
   says i
   i can t expect to live to see that time
  
  being now upwards of fourscore years of age
  and you a young man
  and 
  likely to continue so
  by the help of god
   
   
  i was vexed to see my lady so insensible too
  for all she said was
  
   this is very genteel of you
  sir condy
  you need not wait any longer
  
  thady
   so i just picked up the pen and ink that had tumbled on the 
  floor
  and heard my master finish with saying
   you behaved very genteel 
  to me
  my dear
  when you threw all the little you had in your power 
  along with yourself into my hands
  and as i don t deny but what you may 
  have had some things to complain of
    to be sure he was thinking then 
  of judy
  or of the whisky punch
  one or t other
  or both
    and as i 
  don t deny but you may have had something to complain of
  my dear
  it is 
  but fair you should have something in the form of compensation to look 
  forward to agreeably in future
  besides
  it s an act of justice to 
  myself
  that none of your friends
  my dear
  may ever have it to say 
  against me
  i married for money
  and not for love
   
   
   that is the last thing i should ever have thought of saying of you
  sir 
  condy
   said my lady
  looking very gracious
  
   
   then
  my dear
   said sir condy
   we shall part as good friends as we 
  met
  so all s right
   
   
  i was greatly rejoiced to hear this
  and went out of the parlour to 
  report it all to the kitchen
  the next morning my lady and mrs
  jane 
  set out for mount juliet s town in the jaunting car
  many wondered at 
  my lady s choosing to go away
  considering all things
  upon the 
  jaunting car
  as if it was only a party of pleasure
  but they did not 
  know till i told them that the coach was all broke in the journey down
  
  and no other vehicle but the car to be had
  besides
  my lady s friends 
  were to send their coach to meet her at the cross roads
  so it was all 
  done very proper
  
   
  my poor master was in great trouble after my lady left us
  the execution 
  came down
  and everything at castle rackrent was seized by the gripers
  
  and my son jason
  to his shame be it spoken
  amongst them
  i wondered
  
  for the life of me
  how he could harden himself to do it
  but then he 
  had been studying the law
  and had made himself attorney quirk
  so he 
  brought down at once a heap of accounts upon my master s head
  to cash 
  lent
  and to ditto
  and to ditto
  and to ditto and oats
  and bills paid 
  at the milliner s and linen draper s
  and many dresses for the fancy 
  balls in dublin for my lady
  and all the bills to the workmen and 
  tradesmen for the scenery of the theatre
  and the chandler s and 
  grocer s bills
  and tailor s
  besides butcher s and baker s
  and
  worse 
  than all
  the old one of that base wine merchant s
  that wanted to 
  arrest my poor master for the amount on the election day
  for which 
  amount sir condy afterwards passed his note of hand
  bearing lawful 
  interest from the date thereof
  and the interest and compound interest 
  was now mounted to a terrible deal on many other notes and bonds for 
  money borrowed
  and there was
  besides
  hush money to the sub sheriffs
  
  and sheets upon sheets of old and new attorneys  bills
  with heavy 
  balances
   as per former account furnished
   brought forward with 
  interest thereon
  then there was a powerful deal due to the crown 
  for sixteen years  arrear of quit rent of the town lands of 
  carrickshaughlin
  with driver s fees
  and a compliment to the receiver 
  every year for letting the quit rent run on to oblige sir condy
  and 
  sir kit afore him
  then there were bills for spirits and ribands at the 
  election time
  and the gentlemen of the committee s accounts unsettled
  
  and their subscription never gathered
  and there were cows to be paid 
  for
  with the smith and farrier s bills to be set against the rent of 
  the demesne
  with calf and hay money
  then there was all the servants  
  wages
  since i don t know when
  coming due to them
  and sums advanced 
  for them by my son jason for clothes
  and boots
  and whips
  and odd 
  moneys for sundries expended by them in journeys to town and elsewhere
  
  and pocket money for the master continually
  and messengers and postage 
  before his being a parliament man
  i can t myself tell you what besides
  
  but this i know
  that when the evening came on the which sir condy had 
  appointed to settle all with my son jason
  and when he comes into the 
  parlour
  and sees the sight of bills and load of papers all gathered on 
  the great dining table for him
  he puts his hands before both his eyes
  
  and cried out
   merciful jasus
  what is it i see before me
   then i sets 
  an arm chair at the table for him
  and with a deal of difficulty he sits 
  him down
  and my son jason hands him over the pen and ink to sign to 
  this man s bill and t other man s bill
  all which he did without making 
  the least objections
  indeed
  to give him his due
  i never seen a man 
  more fair and honest
  and easy in all his dealings
  from first to last
  
  as sir condy
  or more willing to pay every man his own as far as he was 
  able
  which is as much as any one can do
  
   
   well
   says he
  joking like with jason
   i wish we could settle it 
  all with a stroke of my grey goose quill
  what signifies making me wade 
  through all this ocean of papers here
  can t you now
  who understand 
  drawing out an account
  debtor and creditor
  just sit down here at the 
  corner of the table and get it done out for me
  that i may have a clear 
  view of the balance
  which is all i need be talking about
  you know
   
   
   very true
  sir condy
  nobody understands business better than 
  yourself
   says jason
  
   
   so i ve a right to do
  being born and bred to the bar
   says sir condy
  
   thady
  do step out and see are they bringing in the things for the 
  punch
  for we ve just done all we have to do for this evening
   
   
  i goes out accordingly
  and when i came back jason was pointing to the 
  balance
  which was a terrible sight to my poor master
  
   
   pooh
  pooh
  pooh
   says he
   here s so many noughts they dazzle my 
  eyes
  so they do
  and put me in mind of all i suffered larning of my 
  numeration table
  when i was a boy at the day school along with you
  
  jason  units
  tens
  hundreds
  tens of hundreds
  is the punch ready
  
  thady
   says he
  seeing me
  
   
   immediately
  the boy has the jug in his hand
  it s coming upstairs
  
  please your honour
  as fast as possible
   says i
  for i saw his honour 
  was tired out of his life
  but jason
  very short and cruel
  cuts me off 
  with   don t be talking of punch yet awhile
  it s no time for punch yet 
  a bit  units
  tens
  hundreds
   goes he on
  counting over the master s 
  shoulder
  units
  tens
  hundreds
  thousands
  
   
   a a ah
  hold your hand
   cries my master
   where in this wide world am 
  i to find hundreds
  or units itself
  let alone thousands
   
   
   the balance has been running on too long
   says jason
  sticking to 
  him as i could not have done at the time
  if you d have given both the 
  indies and cork to boot
   the balance has been running on too long
  and 
  i m distressed myself on your account
  sir condy
  for money
  and the 
  thing must be settled now on the spot
  and the balance cleared off
   
  says jason
  
   
   i ll thank you if you ll only show me how
   says sir condy
  
   
   there s but one way
   says jason
   and that s ready enough
  when 
  there s no cash
  what can a gentleman do but go to the land
   
   
   how can you go to the land
  and it under custodiam to yourself 
  already
   says sir condy
   and another custodiam hanging over it
  and no 
  one at all can touch it
  you know
  but the custodees
   
   
   sure
  can t you sell
  though at a loss
  sure you can sell
  and i ve a 
  purchaser ready for you
   says jason
  
   
   have you so
   says sir condy
   that s a great point gained
  but there s 
  a thing now beyond all
  that perhaps you don t know yet
  barring thady 
  has let you into the secret
   
   
   sarrah bit of a secret
  or anything at all of the kind
  has he learned 
  from me these fifteen weeks come st
  john s eve
   says i
   for we have 
  scarce been upon speaking terms of late
  but what is it your honour 
  means of a secret
   
   
   why
  the secret of the little keepsake i gave my lady rackrent the 
  morning she left us
  that she might not go back empty handed to her 
  friends
   
   
   my lady rackrent
  i m sure
  has baubles and keepsakes enough
  as those 
  bills on the table will show
   says jason
   but whatever it is
   says 
  he
  taking up his pen
   we must add it to the balance
  for to be sure it 
  can t be paid for
   
   
   no
  nor can t till after my decease
   says sir condy
   that s one good 
  thing
   then colouring up a good deal
  he tells jason of the memorandum 
  of the five hundred a year jointure he had settled upon my lady
  at 
  which jason was indeed mad
  and said a great deal in very high words
  
  that it was using a gentleman who had the management of his affairs
  and 
  was
  moreover
  his principal creditor
  extremely ill to do such a thing 
  without consulting him
  and against his knowledge and consent
  to all 
  which sir condy had nothing to reply
  but that
  upon his conscience
  it 
  was in a hurry and without a moment s thought on his part
  and he was 
  very sorry for it
  but if it was to do over again he would do the same
  
  and he appealed to me
  and i was ready to give my evidence
  if that 
  would do
  to the truth of all he said
  
   
  so jason with much ado was brought to agree to a compromise
  
   
   the purchaser that i have ready
   says he
   will be much displeased
  to 
  be sure
  at the encumbrance on the land
  but i must see and manage him
  
  here s a deed ready drawn up
  we have nothing to do but to put in the 
  consideration money and our names to it
   
   
   and how much am i going to sell
   the lands of o shaughlin s town
  and 
  the lands of gruneaghoolaghan
  and the lands of crookagnawaturgh
   says 
  he
  just reading to himself
   and  oh
  murder
  jason
  sure you won t put 
  this in  the castle
  stable
  and appurtenances of castle rackrent
   
   
   oh
  murder
   says i
  clapping my hands
   this is too bad
  jason
   
   
   why so
   said jason
   when it s all
  and a great deal more to the back 
  of it
  lawfully mine
  was i to push for it
   
   
   look at him
   says i
  pointing to sir condy
  who was just leaning back 
  in his arm chair
  with his arms falling beside him like one stupefied
  
   is it you
  jason
  that can stand in his presence
  and recollect all he 
  has been to us
  and all we have been to him
  and yet use him so at the 
  last
   
   
   who will you find to use him better
  i ask you
   said jason
   if he can 
  get a better purchaser
  i m content
  i only offer to purchase
  to make 
  things easy
  and oblige him
  though i don t see what compliment i am 
  under
  if you come to that
  i have never had
  asked
  or charged more 
  than sixpence in the pound
  receiver s fees
  and where would he have got 
  an agent for a penny less
   
   
   oh
  jason
  jason
  how will you stand to this in the face of the county
  
  and all who know you
   says i
   and what will people think and say when 
  they see you living here in castle rackrent
  and the lawful owner turned 
  out of the seat of his ancestors
  without a cabin to put his head into
  
  or so much as a potato to eat
   
   
  jason
  whilst i was saying this
  and a great deal more
  made me signs
  
  and winks
  and frowns
  but i took no heed
  for i was grieved and sick at 
  heart for my poor master
  and couldn t but speak
  
   
   here s the punch
   says jason
  for the door opened
   here s the punch
   
   
  hearing that
  my master starts up in his chair
  and recollects himself
  
  and jason uncorks the whisky
  
   
   set down the jug here
   says he
  making room for it beside the papers 
  opposite to sir condy
  but still not stirring the deed that was to make 
  over all
  
   
  well
  i was in great hopes he had some touch of mercy about him when i 
  saw him making the punch
  and my master took a glass
  but jason put it 
  back as he was going to fill again
  saying
   no
  sir condy
  it shan t 
  be said of me i got your signature to this deed when you were half seas 
  over
  you know your name and handwriting in that condition would not
  if 
  brought before the courts
  benefit me a straw
  wherefore
  let us settle 
  all before we go deeper into the punch bowl
   
   
   settle all as you will
   said sir condy
  clapping his hands to his 
  ears
   but let me hear no more
  i m bothered to death this night
   
   
   you ve only to sign
   said jason
  putting the pen to him
  
   
   take all
  and be content
   said my master
  so he signed
  and the man 
  who brought in the punch witnessed it
  for i was not able
  but crying 
  like a child
  and besides
  jason said
  which i was glad of
  that i was 
  no fit witness
  being so old and doting
  it was so bad with me
  i could 
  not taste a drop of the punch itself
  though my master himself
  god 
  bless him
  in the midst of his trouble
  poured out a glass for me
  and 
  brought it up to my lips
  
   
   not a drop
  i thank your honour s honour as much as if i took it
  
  though
   and i just set down the glass as it was
  and went out
  and when 
  i got to the street door the neighbours  childer
  who were playing at 
  marbles there
  seeing me in great trouble
  left their play
  and gathered 
  about me to know what ailed me
  and i told them all
  for it was a great 
  relief to me to speak to these poor childer
  that seemed to have some 
  natural feeling left in them
  and when they were made sensible that sir 
  condy was going to leave castle rackrent for good and all
  they set up 
  a whillaluh that could be heard to the farthest end of the street
  and 
  one  fine boy he was  that my master had given an apple to that morning
  
  cried the loudest
  but they all were the same sorry
  for sir condy was 
  greatly beloved amongst the childer
  for letting them go a nutting in 
  the demesne
  without saying a word to them
  though my lady objected 
  to them
  the people in the town
  who were the most of them standing at 
  their doors
  hearing the childer cry
  would know the reason of it
  and 
  when the report was made known
  the people one and all gathered in great 
  anger against my son jason
  and terror at the notion of his coming to be 
  landlord over them
  and they cried
   no jason
  no jason
  sir condy
  sir 
  condy
  sir condy rackrent for ever
   and the mob grew so great and so 
  loud
  i was frightened
  and made my way back to the house to warn my son 
  to make his escape
  or hide himself for fear of the consequences
  jason 
  would not believe me till they came all round the house
  and to the 
  windows with great shouts
  then he grew quite pale
  and asked sir condy 
  what had he best do
  
   
   i ll tell you what you had best do
   said sir condy
  who was laughing 
  to see his fright
   finish your glass first
  then let s go to the window 
  and show ourselves
  and i ll tell  em  or you shall
  if you please  that 
  i m going to the lodge for change of air for my health
  and by my own 
  desire
  for the rest of my days
   
   
   do so
   said jason
  who never meant it should have been so but could 
  not refuse him the lodge at this unseasonable time
  accordingly
  sir 
  condy threw up the sash and explained matters
  and thanked all his 
  friends
  and bid them look in at the punchbowl
  and observe that jason 
  and he had been sitting over it very good friends
  so the mob was 
  content
  and he sent them out some whisky to drink his health
  and that 
  was the last time his honour s health was ever drunk at castle rackrent
  
   
  the very next day
  being too proud
  as he said to me
  to stay an hour 
  longer in a house that did not belong to him
  he sets off to the lodge
  
  and i along with him not many hours after
  and there was great bemoaning 
  through all o shaughlin s town
  which i stayed to witness
  and gave my 
  poor master a full account of when i got to the lodge
  he was very low
  
  and in his bed
  when i got there
  and complained of a great pain about 
  his heart
  but i guessed it was only trouble and all the business
  let 
  alone vexation
  he had gone through of late
  and knowing the nature of 
  him from a boy
  i took my pipe
  and whilst smoking it by the chimney 
  began telling him how he was beloved and regretted in the county
  and it 
  did him a deal of good to hear it
  
   
   your honour has a great many friends yet that you don t know of
  rich 
  and poor
  in the county
   says i
   for as i was coming along the road i 
  met two gentlemen in their own carriages
  who asked after you
  knowing 
  me
  and wanted to know where you was and all about you
  and even how old 
  i was
  think of that
   
   
  then he wakened out of his doze
  and began questioning me who the 
  gentlemen were
  and the next morning it came into my head to go
  
  unknown to anybody
  with my master s compliments
  round to many of the 
  gentlemen s houses
  where he and my lady used to visit
  and people that 
  i knew were his great friends
  and would go to cork to serve him any 
  day in the year
  and i made bold to try to borrow a trifle of cash from 
  them
  they all treated me very civil for the most part
  and asked a 
  great many questions very kind about my lady and sir condy and all the 
  family
  and were greatly surprised to learn from me castle rackrent was 
  sold
  and my master at the lodge for health
  and they all pitied him 
  greatly
  and he had their good wishes
  if that would do
  but money was 
  a thing they unfortunately had not any of them at this time to spare
  i 
  had my journey for my pains
  and i
  not used to walking
  nor supple 
  as formerly
  was greatly tired
  but had the satisfaction of telling my 
  master
  when i got to the lodge
  all the civil things said by high and 
  low
  
   
   thady
   says he
   all you ve been telling me brings a strange thought 
  into my head
  i ve a notion i shall not be long for this world anyhow
  
  and i ve a great fancy to see my own funeral afore i die
   i was greatly 
  shocked
  at the first speaking
  to hear him speak so light about his 
  funeral
  and he to all appearance in good health
  but recollecting 
  myself
  answered
  
   
   to be sure it would be as fine a sight as one could see
  i dared to 
  say
  and one i should be proud to witness
  and i did not doubt his 
  honour s would be as great a funeral as ever sir patrick o shaughlin s 
  was
  and such a one as that had never been known in the county afore 
  or since
   but i never thought he was in earnest about seeing his own 
  funeral himself till the next day he returns to it again
  
   
   thady
   says he
   as far as the wake goes
  sure i might without any 
  great trouble have the satisfaction of seeing a bit of my own funeral
   
   a  wake  in england is a meeting avowedly for merriment
  in ireland 
  it is a nocturnal meeting avowedly for the purpose of watching and 
  bewailing the dead
  but in reality for gossiping and debauchery
   see 
  glossary 28   
   
   well
  since your honour s honour s so bent upon it
   says i
  not 
  willing to cross him
  and he in trouble
   we must see what we can do
   
   
  so he fell into a sort of sham disorder
  which was easy done
  as he kept 
  his bed
  and no one to see him
  and i got my shister
  who was an old 
  woman very handy about the sick
  and very skilful
  to come up to the 
  lodge to nurse him
  and we gave out
  she knowing no better
  that he was 
  just at his latter end
  and it answered beyond anything
  and there was 
  a great throng of people
  men
  women
  and childer
  and there being 
  only two rooms at the lodge
  except what was locked up full of jason s 
  furniture and things
  the house was soon as full and fuller than it 
  could hold
  and the heat
  and smoke
  and noise wonderful great
  and 
  standing amongst them that were near the bed
  but not thinking at all 
  of the dead
  i was startled by the sound of my master s voice from under 
  the greatcoats that had been thrown all at top
  and i went close up
  no 
  one noticing
  
   
   thady
   says he
   i ve had enough of this
  i m smothering
  and can t 
  hear a word of all they re saying of the deceased
   
   
   god bless you
  and lie still and quiet
   says i
   a bit longer
  for my 
  shister s afraid of ghosts
  and would die on the spot with fright was 
  she to see you come to life all on a sudden this way without the least 
  preparation
   
   
  so he lays him still
  though well nigh stifled
  and i made all haste to 
  tell the secret of the joke
  whispering to one and t other
  and there 
  was a great surprise
  but not so great as we had laid out it would
   and 
  aren t we to have the pipes and tobacco
  after coming so far to night
   
  said some
  but they were all well enough pleased when his honour got 
  up to drink with them
  and sent for more spirits from a shebeen house 
    shebeen house
   a hedge alehouse
  shebeen properly means weak
  
  small beer
  taplash
  
  where they very civilly let him have it upon 
  credit
  so the night passed off very merrily
  but to my mind sir condy 
  was rather upon the sad order in the midst of it all
  not finding there 
  had been such a great talk about himself after his death as he had 
  always expected to hear
  
   
  the next morning
  when the house was cleared of them
  and none but my 
  shister and myself left in the kitchen with sir condy
  one opens the 
  door and walks in
  and who should it be but judy m quirk herself
  i 
  forgot to notice that she had been married long since
  whilst young 
  captain moneygawl lived at the lodge
  to the captain s huntsman
  who 
  after a whilst  listed and left her
  and was killed in the wars
  poor 
  judy fell off greatly in her good looks after her being married a year 
  or two
  and being smoke dried in the cabin
  and neglecting herself like
  
  it was hard for sir condy himself to know her again till she spoke
  
  but when she says
   it s judy m quirk
  please your honour
  don t you 
  remember her
   
   
   oh
  judy
  is it you
   says his honour
   yes
  sure
  i remember you very 
  well
  but you re greatly altered
  judy
   
   
   sure it s time for me
   says she
   and i think your honour
  since i 
  seen you last  but that s a great while ago  is altered too
   
   
   and with reason
  judy
   says sir condy
  fetching a sort of a sigh
   but 
  how s this
  judy
   he goes on
   i take it a little amiss of you that you 
  were not at my wake last night
   
   
   ah
  don t be being jealous of that
   says she
   i didn t hear a 
  sentence of your honour s wake till it was all over
  or it would have 
  gone hard with me but i would have been at it
  sure
  but i was forced to 
  go ten miles up the country three days ago to a wedding of a relation of 
  my own s
  and didn t get home till after the wake was over
  but
   says 
  she
   it won t be so
  i hope
  the next time
  please your honour
   
   at the coronation of one of our monarchs the king complained of the 
  confusion which happened in the procession
   the great officer who 
  presided told his majesty that  it should not be so next time
    
   
   that we shall see
  judy
   says his honour
   and maybe sooner than you 
  think for
  for i ve been very unwell this while past
  and don t reckon 
  anyway i m long for this world
   
   
  at this judy takes up the corner of her apron
  and puts it first to one 
  eye and then to t other
  being to all appearance in great trouble
  and 
  my shister put in her word
  and bid his honour have a good heart
  for 
  she was sure it was only the gout that sir patrick used to have flying 
  about him
  and he ought to drink a glass or a bottle extraordinary to 
  keep it out of his stomach
  and he promised to take her advice
  and sent 
  out for more spirits immediately
  and judy made a sign to me
  and i went 
  over to the door to her
  and she said
   i wonder to see sir condy so 
  low
  has he heard the news
   
   
   what news
   says i
  
   
   didn t ye hear it
  then
   says she
   my lady rackrent that was is kilt 
   see glossary 29  and lying for dead
  and i don t doubt but it s all 
  over with her by this time
   
   
   mercy on us all
   says i
   how was it
   
   
   the jaunting car it was that ran away with her
   says judy
   i was 
  coming home that same time from biddy m guggin s marriage
  and a 
  great crowd of people too upon the road
  coming from the fair of 
  crookaghnawaturgh
  and i sees a jaunting car standing in the middle of 
  the road
  and with the two wheels off and all tattered
  
 what s this
 
  
   says i
  
 didn t ye hear of it
 
  says they that were looking on
  
 it s 
  my lady rackrent s car
  that was running away from her husband
  and the 
  horse took fright at a carrion that lay across the road
  and so ran away 
  with the jaunting car
  and my lady rackrent and her maid screaming
  and 
  the horse ran with them against a car that was coming from the fair 
  with the boy asleep on it
  and the lady s petticoat hanging out of the 
  jaunting car caught
  and she was dragged i can t tell you how far upon 
  the road
  and it all broken up with the stones just going to be pounded
  
  and one of the road makers
  with his sledge hammer in his hand
  stops 
  the horse at the last
  but my lady rackrent was all kilt and smashed
 
  
    kilt and smashed
   our author is not here guilty of an anti climax
  the 
  mere english reader
  from a similarity of sound between the words 
   kilt  and  killed
   might be induced to suppose that their meanings are 
  similar
  yet they are not by any means in ireland synonymous terms
  thus 
  you may hear a man exclaim
   i m kilt and murdered
   but he frequently 
  means only that he has received a black eye or a slight contusion
  
   i m kilt all over  means that he is in a worse state than being simply 
   kilt
   thus
   i m kilt with the cold
   is nothing to  i m kilt all over 
  with the rheumatism
    and they lifted her into a cabin hard by
  and the 
  maid was found after where she had been thrown in the gripe of a ditch
  
  her cap and bonnet all full of bog water
  and they say my lady can t 
  live anyway
  thady
  pray now is it true what i m told for sartain
  that 
  sir condy has made over all to your son jason
   
   
   all
   says i
  
   
   all entirely
   says she again
  
   
   all entirely  says i
  
   
   then
   says she
   that s a great shame
  but don t be telling jason what 
  i say
   
   
   and what is it you say
   cries sir condy
  leaning over betwixt us
  
  which made judy start greatly
   i know the time when judy m quirk would 
  never have stayed so long talking at the door and i in the house
   
   
   oh
   says judy
   for shame
  sir condy
  times are altered since then
  
  and it s my lady rackrent you ought to be thinking of
   
   
   and why should i be thinking of her
  that s not thinking of me now
   
  says sir condy
  
   
   no matter for that
   says judy
  very properly
   it s time you should 
  be thinking of her
  if ever you mean to do it at all
  for don t you know 
  she s lying for death
   
   
   my lady rackrent
   says sir condy
  in a surprise
   why it s but two 
  days since we parted
  as you very well know
  thady
  in her full health 
  and spirits
  and she
  and her maid along with her
  going to mount 
  juliet s town on her jaunting car
  
   
   she ll never ride no more on her jaunting car
   said judy
   for it has 
  been the death of her
  sure enough
   
   
  and is she dead then
   says his honour
  
   
   as good as dead
  i hear
   says judy
   but there s thady here as just 
  learnt the whole truth of the story as i had it
  and it s fitter he or 
  anybody else should be telling it you than i
  sir condy
  i must be going 
  home to the childer
   
   
  but he stops her
  but rather from civility in him
  as i could see very 
  plainly
  than anything else
  for judy was
  as his honour remarked at her 
  first coming in
  greatly changed
  and little likely
  as far as i could 
  see  though she did not seem to be clear of it herself  little likely 
  to be my lady rackrent now
  should there be a second toss up to be made
  
  but i told him the whole story out of the face
  just as judy had told 
  it to me
  and he sent off a messenger with his compliments to mount 
  juliet s town that evening
  to learn the truth of the report
  and 
  judy bid the boy that was going call in at tim m enerney s shop in 
  o shaughlin s town and buy her a new shawl
  
   
   do so
   said sir condy
   and tell tim to take no money from you
  for i 
  must pay him for the shawl myself
   at this my shister throws me over 
  a look
  and i says nothing
  but turned the tobacco in my mouth
  whilst 
  judy began making a many words about it
  and saying how she could not be 
  beholden for shawls to any gentleman
  i left her there to consult with 
  my shister
  did she think there was anything in it
  and my shister 
  thought i was blind to be asking her the question
  and i thought my 
  shister must see more into it than i did
  and recollecting all past 
  times and everything
  i changed my mind
  and came over to her way 
  of thinking
  and we settled it that judy was very like to be my lady 
  rackrent after all
  if a vacancy should have happened
  
   
  the next day
  before his honour was up
  somebody comes with a double 
  knock at the door
  and i was greatly surprised to see it was my son 
  jason
  
   
   jason
  is it you
   said i
   what brings you to the lodge
   says i
   is 
  it my lady rackrent
  we know that already since yesterday
   
   
   maybe so
   says he
   but i must see sir condy about it
   
   
   you can t see him yet
   says i
   sure he is not awake
   
   
   what then
   says he
   can t he be wakened
  and i standing at the door
   
   
   i ll not
  be disturbing his honour for you
  jason
   says i
   many s 
  the hour you ve waited in your time
  and been proud to do it
  till his 
  honour was at leisure to speak to you
  his honour
   says i
  raising my 
  voice
  at which his honour wakens of his own accord
  and calls to me 
  from the room to know who it was i was speaking to
  jason made no more 
  ceremony
  but follows me into the room
  
   
   how are you
  sir condy
   says he
   i m happy to see you looking so 
  well
  i came up to know how you did to day
  and to see did you want for 
  anything at the lodge
   
   
   nothing at all
  mr
  jason
  i thank you
   says he
  for his honour had 
  his own share of pride
  and did not choose
  after all that had passed
  
  to be beholden
  i suppose
  to my son
   but pray take a chair and be 
  seated
  mr
  jason
   
   
  jason sat him down upon the chest
  for chair there was none
  and after 
  he had set there some time
  and a silence on all sides
  
   
   what news is there stirring in the country
  mr
  jason m quirk
   says 
  sir condy
  very easy
  yet high like
  
   
   none that s news to you
  sir condy
  i hear
   says jason
   i am sorry to 
  hear of my lady rackrent s accident
   
   
   i m much obliged to you
  and so is her ladyship
  i m sure
   answered 
  sir condy
  still stiff
  and there was another sort of a silence
  which 
  seemed to lie the heaviest on my son jason
  
   
   sir condy
   says he at last
  seeing sir condy disposing himself to go 
  to sleep again
   sir condy
  i daresay you recollect mentioning to me 
  the little memorandum you gave to lady rackrent about the l500 a year 
  jointure
   
   
   very true
   said sir condy
   it is all in my recollection
    but if my 
  lady rackrent dies
  there s an end of all jointure
   says jason
  
   
   of course
   says sir condy
  
   
   but it s not a matter of certainty that my lady rackrent won t 
  recover
   says jason
  
   
   very true
  sir
   says my master
  
   
   it s a fair speculation
  then
  for you to consider what the chance of 
  the jointure of those lands
  when out of custodiam
  will be to you
   
   
   just five hundred a year
  i take it
  without any speculation at all
   
  said sir condy
  
   
   that s supposing the life dropt
  and the custodiam off
  you know
  
  begging your pardon
  sir condy
  who understands business
  that is a 
  wrong calculation
   
   
   very likely so
   said sir condy
   but
  mr
  jason
  if you have anything 
  to say to me this morning about it
  i d be obliged to you to say it
  for 
  i had an indifferent night s rest last night
  and wouldn t be sorry to 
  sleep a little this morning
   
   
   i have only three words to say
  and those more of consequence to you
  
  sir condy
  than me
  you are a little cool
  i observe
  but i hope you 
  will not be offended at what i have brought here in my pocket
   and he 
  pulls out two long rolls
  and showers down golden guineas upon the bed
  
   
   what s this
   said sir condy
   it s long since   but his pride stops 
  him
  
   
   all these are your lawful property this minute
  sir condy
  if you 
  please
   said jason
  
   
   not for nothing
  i m sure
   said sir condy
  and laughs a little
  
   nothing for nothing
  or i m under a mistake with you
  jason
   
   
   oh
  sir condy
  we ll not be indulging ourselves in any unpleasant 
  retrospects
   says jason
   it s my present intention to behave
  as 
  i m sure you will
  like a gentleman in this affair
  here s two hundred 
  guineas
  and a third i mean to add if you should think proper to make 
  over to me all your right and title to those lands that you know of
   
   
   i ll consider of it
   said my master
  and a great deal more
  that i was 
  tired listening to
  was said by jason
  and all that
  and the sight of 
  the ready cash upon the bed
  worked with his honour
  and the short and 
  the long of it was
  sir condy gathered up the golden guineas
  and tied 
  them up in a handkerchief
  and signed some paper jason brought with him 
  as usual
  and there was an end of the business
  jason took himself away
  
  and my master turned himself round and fell asleep again
  
   
  i soon found what had put jason in such a hurry to conclude this 
  business
  the little gossoon we had sent off the day before with my 
  master s compliments to mount juliet s town
  and to know how my lady did 
  after her accident
  was stopped early this morning
  coming back with his 
  answer through o shaughlin s town
  at castle rackrent
  by my son jason
  
  and questioned of all he knew of my lady from the servant at mount 
  juliet s town
  and the gossoon told him my lady rackrent was not 
  expected to live over night
  so jason thought it high time to be moving 
  to the lodge
  to make his bargain with my master about the jointure 
  afore it should be too late
  and afore the little gossoon should reach 
  us with the news
  my master was greatly vexed  that is
  i may say
  as 
  much as ever i seen him when he found how he had been taken in
  but it 
  was some comfort to have the ready cash for immediate consumption in the 
  house
  anyway
  
   
  and when judy came up that evening
  and brought the childer to see his 
  honour
  he unties the handkerchief
  and  god bless him
  whether it was 
  little or much he had
   twas all the same with him  he gives  em all 
  round guineas apiece
  
   
   hold up your head
   says my shister to judy
  as sir condy was busy 
  filling out a glass of punch for her eldest boy   hold up your head
  
  judy
  for who knows but we may live to see you yet at the head of the 
  castle rackrent estate
   
   
   maybe so
   says she
   but not the way you are thinking of
   
   
  i did not rightly understand which way judy was looking when she made 
  this speech till a while after
  
   
   why
  thady
  you were telling me yesterday that sir condy had sold 
  all entirely to jason
  and where then does all them guineas in the 
  handkerchief come from
   
   
   they are the purchase money of my lady s jointure
   says i
  
   
  judy looks a little bit puzzled at this
   a penny for your thoughts
  
  judy
   says my shister
   hark
  sure sir condy is drinking her health
   
   
  he was at the table in the room  the room  the principal room in the 
  house 
  drinking with the excise man and the gauger
  who came up to see 
  his honour
  and we were standing over the fire in the kitchen
  
   
   i don t much care is he drinking my health or not
   says judy
   and it 
  is not sir condy i m thinking of
  with all your jokes
  whatever he is of 
  me
   
   
   sure you wouldn t refuse to be my lady rackrent
  judy
  if you had the 
  offer
   says i
  
   
   but if i could do better
   says she
  
   
   how better
   says i and my shister both at once
  
   
   how better
   says she
   why
  what signifies it to be my lady rackrent 
  and no castle
  sure what good is the car
  and no horse to draw it
   
   
   and where will ye get the horse
  judy
   says i
  
   
   never mind that
   says she
   maybe it is your own son jason might find 
  that
   
   
   jason
   says i
   don t be trusting to him
  judy
  sir condy
  as i 
  have good reason to know
  spoke well of you when jason spoke very 
  indifferently of you
  judy
   
   
   no matter
   says judy
   it s often men speak the contrary just to what 
  they think of us
   
   
   and you the same way of them
  no doubt
   answered i
   nay
  don t he 
  denying it
  judy
  for i think the better of ye for it
  and shouldn t be 
  proud to call ye the daughter of a shister s son of mine
  if i was to 
  hear ye talk ungrateful
  and anyway disrespectful of his honour
   
   
   what disrespect
   says she
   to say i d rather
  if it was my luck
  be 
  the wife of another man
   
   
   you ll have no luck
  mind my words
  judy
   says i
  and all i remembered 
  about my poor master s goodness in tossing up for her afore he married 
  at all came across me
  and i had a choking in my throat that hindered me 
  to say more
  
   
   better luck
  anyhow
  thady
   says she
   than to be like some folk
  
  following the fortunes of them that have none left
   
   
  oh
  king of glory
   says i
   hear the pride and ungratitude of her
  and 
  he giving his last guineas but a minute ago to her childer
  and she with 
  the fine shawl on her he made her a present of but yesterday
   
   
   oh
  troth
  judy
  you re wrong now
   says my shister
  looking at the 
  shawl
  
   
   and was not he wrong yesterday
  then
   says she
   to be telling me i 
  was greatly altered
  to affront me
   
   
   but
  judy
   says i
   what is it brings you here then at all in the 
  mind you are in
  is it to make jason think the better of you
   
   
   i ll tell you no more of my secrets
  thady
   says she
   nor would have 
  told you this much
  had i taken you for such an unnatural fader as i 
  find you are
  not to wish your own son prefarred to another
   
   
   oh
  troth
  you are wrong now
  thady
   says my shister
  
   
  well
  i was never so put to it in my life
  between these womens
  and 
  my son and my master
  and all i felt and thought just now
  i could not
  
  upon my conscience
  tell which was the wrong from the right
  so i said 
  not a word more
  but was only glad his honour had not the luck to hear 
  all judy had been saying of him
  for i reckoned it would have gone nigh 
  to break his heart
  not that i was of opinion he cared for her as much 
  as she and my shister fancied
  but the ungratitude of the whole from 
  judy might not plase him
  and he could never stand the notion of not 
  being well spoken of or beloved like behind his back
  fortunately for 
  all parties concerned
  he was so much elevated at this time
  there was 
  no danger of his understanding anything
  even if it had reached his 
  ears
  there was a great horn at the lodge
  ever since my master and 
  captain moneygawl was in together
  that used to belong originally to the 
  celebrated sir patrick
  his ancestor
  and his honour was fond often of 
  telling the story that he learned from me when a child
  how sir patrick 
  drank the full of this horn without stopping
  and this was what no 
  other man afore or since could without drawing breath
  now sir condy 
  challenged the gauger
  who seemed to think little of the horn
  to 
  swallow the contents
  and had it filled to the brim with punch
  and the 
  gauger said it was what he could not do for nothing
  but he d hold sir 
  condy a hundred guineas he d do it
  
   
   done
   says my master
   i ll lay you a hundred golden guineas to a 
  tester you don t
    tester
  sixpence
  from the french word tete
  a 
  head  a piece of silver stamped with a head
  which in old french was 
  called un testion
  and which was about the value of an old english 
  sixpence
   tester  is used in shakspeare
   
   
   done
   says the gauger
  and done and done s enough between two 
  gentlemen
  the gauger was cast
  and my master won the bet
  and thought 
  he d won a hundred guineas
  but by the wording it was adjudged to be 
  only a tester that was his due by the exciseman
  it was all one to him
  
  he was as well pleased
  and i was glad to see him in such spirits again
  
   
  the gauger  bad luck to him
   was the man that next proposed to my 
  master to try himself
  could he take at a draught the contents of the 
  great horn
  
   
   sir patrick s horn
   said his honour
   hand it to me
  i ll hold you 
  your own bet over again i ll swallow it
   
   
   done
   says the gauger
   i ll lay ye anything at all you do no such 
  thing
   
   
   a hundred guineas to sixpence i do
   says he
   bring me the 
  handkerchief
   i was loth
  knowing he meant the handkerchief with the 
  gold in it
  to bring it out in such company
  and his honour not very 
  able to reckon it
   bring me the handkerchief
  then
  thady
   says he
  
  and stamps with his foot
  so with that i pulls it out of my greatcoat 
  pocket
  where i had put it for safety
  oh
  how it grieved me to see the 
  guineas counting upon the table
  and they the last my master had
  says 
  sir condy to me
   your hand is steadier than mine to night
  old thady
  
  and that s a wonder
  fill you the horn for me
   and so
  wishing his 
  honour success
  i did
  but i filled it
  little thinking of what would 
  befall him
  he swallows it down
  and drops like one shot
  we lifts him 
  up
  and he was speechless
  and quite black in the face
  we put him to 
  bed
  and in a short time he wakened
  raving with a fever on his brain
  
  he was shocking either to see or hear
  
   
   judy
  judy
  have you no touch of feeling
  won t you stay to help us 
  nurse him
   says i to her
  and she putting on her shawl to go out of the 
  house
  
   
   i m frightened to see him
   says she
   and wouldn t nor couldn t stay 
  in it
  and what use
  he can t last till the morning
   with that she ran 
  off
  there was none but my shister and myself left near him of all the 
  many friends he had
  
   
  the fever came and went
  and came and went
  and lasted five days
  and 
  the sixth he was sensible for a few minutes
  and said to me
  knowing me 
  very well
   i m in a burning pain all withinside of me
  thady
   i could 
  not speak
  but my shister asked him would he have this thing or t other 
  to do him good
   no
   says he
   nothing will do me good no more
   and 
  he gave a terrible screech with the torture he was in
  then again a 
  minute s ease   brought to this by drink
   says he
   where are all the 
  friends
   where s judy
  gone
  hey
  ay
  sir condy has been a fool all his 
  days
   said he
  and there was the last word he spoke
  and died
  he had 
  but a very poor funeral after all
  
   
  if you want to know any more
  i m not very well able to tell you
  but 
  my lady rackrent did not die
  as was expected of her
  but was only 
  disfigured in the face ever after by the fall and bruises she got
  and 
  she and jason
  immediately after my poor master s death
  set about going 
  to law about that jointure
  the memorandum not being on stamped paper
  
  some say it is worth nothing
  others again it may do
  others say jason 
  won t have the lands at any rate
  many wishes it so
  for my part
  i m 
  tired wishing for anything in this world
  after all i ve seen in it
  but 
  i ll say nothing  it would be a folly to be getting myself ill will 
  in my old age
  jason did not marry
  nor think of marrying judy
  as i 
  prophesied
  and i am not sorry for it
  who is
  as for all i have here 
  set down from memory and hearsay of the family
  there s nothing but 
  truth in it from beginning to end
  that you may depend upon
  for where s 
  the use of telling lies about the things which everybody knows as well 
  as i do
  
   
  the editor could have readily made the catastrophe of sir condy s 
  history more dramatic and more pathetic
  if he thought it allowable to 
  varnish the plain round tale of faithful thady
  he lays it before the 
  english reader as a specimen of manners and characters which are perhaps 
  unknown in england
  indeed
  the domestic habits of no nation in europe 
  were less known to the english than those of their sister country
  till 
  within these few years
  
   
  mr
  young s picture of ireland
  in his tour through that country
  was 
  the first faithful portrait of its inhabitants
  all the features in the 
  foregoing sketch were taken from the life
  and they are characteristic 
  of that mixture of quickness
  simplicity
  cunning
  carelessness
  
  dissipation
  disinterestedness
  shrewdness
  and blunder
  which
  in 
  different forms and with various success
  has been brought upon the 
  stage or delineated in novels
  
   
  it is a problem of difficult solution to determine whether a union will 
  hasten or retard the amelioration of this country
  the few gentlemen of 
  education who now reside in this country will resort to england
  they 
  are few
  but they are in nothing inferior to men of the same rank in 
  great britain
  the best that can happen will be the introduction of 
  british manufacturers in their places
  
   
  did the warwickshire militia
  who were chiefly artisans
  teach the irish 
  to drink beer
  or did they learn from the irish to drink whisky
