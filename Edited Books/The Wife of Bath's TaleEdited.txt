 in th  olde dayes of the kyng arthour
  
   of which that britons speken greet honour
  
   al was this land fulfild of fayerye
  
  860 the elf queene
  with hir joly compaignye
  
   daunced ful ofte in many a grene mede
  
   this was the olde opinion
  as i rede
  
   i speke of manye hundred yeres ago
  
   but now kan no man se none elves mo
  
   for now the grete charitee and prayeres 
   of lymytours and othere hooly freres
  
   that serchen every lond and every streem
  
   as thikke as motes in the sonne beem
  
   blessynge halles

  870 citees
  burghes
  castels
  hye toures
  
   thropes

  dayeryes    
   this maketh that ther ben no fayeryes
  
   for ther as wont to walken was an elf 
   ther walketh now the lymytour hymself 
   in undermeles and in morwenynges
  
   and seyth his matyns and his hooly thynges 
   as he gooth in his lymytacioun
  
   wommen may go saufly up and doun
  
   in every bussh or under every tree 
  880 ther is noon oother incubus but he

   and so bifel that this kyng arthour 
   hadde in his hous a lusty bacheler

   he saugh a mayde walkynge hym biforn
  
   of which mayde anon
  maugree hir heed
  
   by verray force
  he rafte hire maydenhed
  
   for which oppressioun was swich clamour 
  890 and swich pursute unto the kyng arthour 
   that dampned was this knyght for to be deed
  
   by cours of lawe
  and sholde han lost his heed    
   paraventure swich was the statut tho    
   but that the queene and other ladyes mo 
   so longe preyeden the kyng of grace 
   til he his lyf hym graunted in the place
  
   and yaf hym to the queene
  al at hir wille
  
   to chese wheither she wolde hym save or spille
  
   the queene thanketh the kyng with al hir myght

  nay
  
   it wol nat been amended nevere mo
  
  1100 thou art so loothly
  and so oold also
  
   and therto comen of so lough a kynde
  
   that litel wonder is thogh i walwe and wynde
  
   so wolde god myn herte wolde breste

 i koude amende al this
  
   if that me liste
  er it were dayes thre
  
   so wel ye myghte bere yow unto me
  
   
 but
  for ye speken of swich gentillesse 
  1110 as is descended out of old richesse
  
   that therfore sholden ye be gentil men
  
   swich arrogance is nat worth an hen
  
   looke who that is moost vertuous alway
  
   pryvee and apert
  and moost entendeth ay 
   to do the gentil dedes that he kan
  
   taak hym for the grettest gentil man
  
   crist wole we clayme of hym oure gentillesse
  
   nat of oure eldres for hire old richesse
  
   for thogh they yeve us al hir heritage
  
  1120 for which we clayme to been of heigh parage
  
   yet may they nat biquethe for no thyng 
   to noon of us hir vertuous lyvyng
  
   that made hem gentil men ycalled be
  
   and bad us folwen hem in swich degree
  
   
 wel kan the wise poete of florence
  
   that highte dant
  speken in this sentence
  
   lo
  in swich maner rym is dantes tale
  
    ful selde up riseth by his branches smale 
   prowesse of man
  for god
  of his goodnesse
  
  1130 wole that of hym we clayme oure gentillesse 
  
   for of oure eldres may we no thyng clayme 
   but temporel thyng
  that man may hurte and mayme
  
   
 eek every wight woot this as wel as i
  
   if gentillesse were planted natureelly 
   unto a certeyn lynage doun the lyne
  
   pryvee and apert thanne wolde they nevere fyne 
   to doon of gentillesse the faire office
  
   they myghte do no vileynye or vice
  
   
 taak fyr and ber it in the derkeste hous 
  1140 bitwix this and the mount of kaukasous
  
   and lat men shette the dores and go thenne
  
   yet wole the fyr as faire lye and brenne 
   as twenty thousand men myghte it biholde
  
   his office natureel ay wol it holde
  
   up peril of my lyf
  til that it dye
  
   
 heere may ye se wel how that genterye 
   is nat annexed to possessioun
  
   sith folk ne doon hir operacioun 
   alwey
  as dooth the fyr
  lo
  in his kynde
  
  1150 for
  god it woot
  men may wel often fynde 
   a lordes sone do shame and vileynye
  
   and he that wole han pris of his gentrye
  
   for he was boren of a gentil hous 
   and hadde his eldres noble and vertuous
  
   and nel hymselven do no gentil dedis 
   ne folwen his gentil auncestre that deed is
  
   he nys nat gentil
  be he duc or erl
  
   for vileyns synful dedes make a cherl
  
   for gentillesse nys but renomee 
  1160 of thyne auncestres
  for hire heigh bountee
  
   which is a strange thyng to thy persone
  
   thy gentillesse cometh fro god allone
  
   thanne comth oure verray gentillesse of grace
  
   it was no thyng biquethe us with oure place
  
   
 thenketh hou noble
  as seith valerius
  
   was thilke tullius hostillius
  
   that out of poverte roos to heigh noblesse
  
   reedeth senek
  and redeth eek boece
  
   ther shul ye seen expres that it no drede is 
  1170 that he is gentil that dooth gentil dedis
  
   and therfore
  leeve housbonde
  i thus conclude
  
   al were it that myne auncestres were rude
  
   yet may the hye god
  and so hope i
  
   grante me grace to lyven vertuously
  
   thanne am i gentil
  whan that i bigynne 
   to lyven vertuously and weyve synne
  
   
 and ther as ye of poverte me repreeve
  
   the hye god
  on whom that we bileeve
  
   in wilful poverte chees to lyve his lyf
  
  1180 and certes every man
  mayden
  or wyf 
   may understonde that jhesus
  hevene kyng
  
   ne wolde nat chese a vicious lyvyng
  
   glad poverte is an honest thyng
  certeyn
  
   this wole senec and othere clerkes seyn
  
   whoso that halt hym payd of his poverte
  
   i holde hym riche
  al hadde he nat a sherte
  
   he that coveiteth is a povre wight
  
   for he wolde han that is nat in his myght
  
   but he that noght hath
  ne coveiteth have
  
  1190 is riche
  although ye holde hym but a knave
  
   verray poverte
  it syngeth proprely
  
   juvenal seith of poverte myrily
  
    the povre man
  whan he goth by the weye
  
   bifore the theves he may synge and pleye
   
   poverte is hateful good and
  as i gesse
  
   a ful greet bryngere out of bisynesse
  
   a greet amendere eek of sapience 
   to hym that taketh it in pacience
  
   poverte is this
  although it seme alenge
  
  1200 possessioun that no wight wol chalenge
  
   poverte ful ofte
  whan a man is lowe
  
   maketh his god and eek hymself to knowe
  
   poverte a spectacle is
  as thynketh me
  
   thurgh which he may his verray freendes see
  
   and therfore
  sire
  syn that i noght yow greve
  
   of my poverte namoore ye me repreve
  
   
 now

  of elde ye repreve me
  
   and certes
