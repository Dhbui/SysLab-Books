 a prentys whilom dwelled in oure citee
  
   and of a craft of vitailliers was hee
  
   gaillard he was as goldfynch in the shawe
  
   broun as a berye
  a propre short felawe
  
   with lokkes blake
  ykembd ful fetisly
  
  4370 dauncen he koude so wel and jolily 
   that he was cleped perkyn revelour
  
   he was as ful of love and paramour 
   as is the hyve ful of hony sweete
  
   wel was the wenche with hym myghte meete
  
   at every bridale wolde he synge and hoppe
  
   he loved bet the taverne than the shoppe
  
   for whan ther any ridyng was in chepe
  
   out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe    
   til that he hadde al the sighte yseyn
  
  4380 and daunced wel
  he wolde nat come ayeyn    
   and gadered hym a meynee of his sort 
   to hoppe and synge and maken swich disport
  
   and ther they setten stevene for to meete
  
   to pleyen at the dys in swich a streete
  
   for in the toune nas ther no prentys 
   that fairer koude caste a paire of dys 
   than perkyn koude
  and therto he was free 
   of his dispense
  in place of pryvetee
  
   that fond his maister wel in his chaffare
  
  4390 for often tyme he foond his box ful bare
  
   for sikerly a prentys revelour 
   that haunteth dys
  riot
  or paramour
  
   his maister shal it in his shoppe abye
  
   al have he no part of the mynstralcye
  
   for thefte and riot
  they been convertible
  
   al konne he pleye on gyterne or ribible
  
   revel and trouthe
  as in a lowe degree
  
   they been ful wrothe al day
  as men may see
  
   this joly prentys with his maister bood
  
  4400 til he were ny out of his prentishood
  
   al were he snybbed bothe erly and late
  
   and somtyme lad with revel to newegate
  
   but atte laste his maister hym bithoghte
  
   upon a day
  whan he his papir soghte
  
   of a proverbe that seith this same word
  
   
 wel bet is roten appul out of hoord 
   than that it rotie al the remenaunt
 
  
   so fareth it by a riotous servaunt
  
   it is ful lasse harm to lete hym pace
  
  4410 than he shende alle the servantz in the place
  
   therfore his maister yaf hym acquitance
  
   and bad hym go
  with sorwe and with meschance
  
   and thus this joly prentys hadde his leve
  
   now lat hym riote al the nyght or leve
  
   and for ther is no theef withoute a lowke
  
   that helpeth hym to wasten and to sowke 
   of that he brybe kan or borwe may
  
   anon he sente his bed and his array 
   unto a compeer of his owene sort
  
  4420 that lovede dys
  and revel
  and disport
  
   and hadde a wyf that heeld for contenance 
   a shoppe
  and swyved for hir sustenance
