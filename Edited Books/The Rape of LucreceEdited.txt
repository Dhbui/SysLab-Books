                  the rape of lucrece 
   
   
   
                        to the 
   
            right honourable henry wriothesly
  
   
          earl of southampton
  and baron of titchfield
  
   
  the love i dedicate to your lordship is without end
  whereof this 
  pamphlet
  without beginning
  is but a superfluous moiety
   the 
  warrant i have of your honourable disposition
  not the worth of 
  my untutored lines
  makes it assured of acceptance
   what i have 
  done is yours
  what i have to do is yours
  being part in all i 
  have
  devoted yours
   were my worth greater
  my duty would show 
  greater
  meantime
  as it is
  it is bound to your lordship
  to 
  whom i wish long life
  still lengthened with all happiness
  
   
                           your lordship s in all duty
  
                                william shakespeare
  
   
   
   
   
                          the argument
  
   
  lucius tarquinius  for his excessive pride surnamed superbus 
  
  after he had caused his own father in law
  servius tullius
  to be 
  cruelly murdered
  and
  contrary to the roman laws and customs
  
  not requiring or staying for the people s suffrages
  had 
  possessed himself of the kingdom
  went
  accompanied with his sons 
  and other noblemen of rome
  to besiege ardea
   during which siege 
  the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of 
  sextus tarquinius
  the king s son
  in their discourses after 
  supper
  every one commended the virtues of his own wife
  among 
  whom collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife 
  lucretia
  in that pleasant humour they all posted to rome
  and 
  intending
  by their secret and sudden arrival
  to make trial of 
  that which every one had before avouched
  only collatinus finds 
  his wife
  though it were late in the night
  spinning amongst her 
  maids
  the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling
  or 
  in several disports
   whereupon the noblemen yielded collatinus 
  the victory
  and his wife the fame
   at that time sextus 
  tarquinius being inflamed with lucrece s beauty
  yet smothering 
  his passions for the present
  departed with the rest back to the 
  camp
  from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself
  and 
  was  according to his estate  royally entertained and lodged by 
  lucrece at collatium
   the same night he treacherously stealeth 
  into her chamber
  violently ravished her
  and early in the 
  morning speedeth away
  lucrece
  in this lamentable plight
  
  hastily dispatched messengers
  one to rome for her father
  
  another to the camp for collatine
   they came
  the one 
  accompanied with junius brutus
  the other with publius valerius
  
  and finding lucrece attired in mourning habit
  demanded the cause 
  of her sorrow
   she
  first taking an oath of them for her 
  revenge
  revealed the actor
  and whole manner of his dealing
  and 
  withal suddenly stabbed herself
   which done
  with one consent 
  they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the 
  tarquins
  and bearing the dead body to rome
  brutus acquainted 
  the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed
  with a 
  bitter invective against the tyranny of the king
  wherewith the 
  people were so moved
  that with one consent and a general 
  acclamation the tarquins were all exiled
  and the state 
  government changed from kings to consuls
  
   
                                                                  
   
  from the besieged ardea all in post
  
  borne by the trustless wings of false desire
  
  lust breathed tarquin leaves the roman host
  
  and to collatium bears the lightless fire 
  which
  in pale embers hid
  lurks to aspire 
    and girdle with embracing flames the waist 
    of collatine s fair love
  lucrece the chaste
  
   
  haply that name of chaste unhapp ly set 
  this bateless edge on his keen appetite
  
  when collatine unwisely did not let 
  to praise the clear unmatched red and white 
  which triumph d in that sky of his delight
  
    where mortal stars
  as bright as heaven s beauties
  
    with pure aspects did him peculiar duties
  
   
  for he the night before
  in tarquin s tent
  
  unlock d the treasure of his happy state
  
  what priceless wealth the heavens had him lent 
  in the possession of his beauteous mate
  
  reckoning his fortune at such high proud rate
  
    that kings might be espoused to more fame
  
    but king nor peer to such a peerless dame
  
   
  o happiness enjoy d but of a few
  
  and
  if possess d
  as soon decay d and done 
  as is the morning s silver melting dew 
  against the golden splendour of the sun
  
  an expir d date
  cancell d ere well begun
  
    honour and beauty
  in the owner s arms
  
    are weakly fortress d from a world of harms
  
   
  beauty itself doth of itself persuade 
  the eyes of men without an orator
  
  what needeth then apologies be made
  
  to set forth that which is so singular
  
  or why is collatine the publisher 
    of that rich jewel he should keep unknown 
    from thievish ears
  because it is his own
  
   
  perchance his boast of lucrece  sovereignty 
  suggested this proud issue of a king
  
  for by our ears our hearts oft tainted be
  
  perchance that envy of so rich a thing
  
  braving compare
  disdainfully did sting 
    his high pitch d thoughts
  that meaner men should vaunt 
    that golden hap which their superiors want
  
   
  but some untimely thought did instigate 
  his all too timeless speed
  if none of those
  
  his honour
  his affairs
  his friends
  his state
  
  neglected all
  with swift intent he goes 
  to quench the coal which in his liver glows
  
    o rash false heat
  wrapp d in repentant cold
  
    thy hasty spring still blasts
  and ne er grows old
  
   
  when at collatium this false lord arriv d
  
  well was he welcom d by the roman dame
  
  within whose face beauty and virtue striv d 
  which of them both should underprop her fame
  
  when virtue bragg d
  beauty would blush for shame
  
    when beauty boasted blushes
  in despite 
    virtue would stain that or with silver white
  
   
  but beauty
  in that white intituled
  
  from venus  doves doth challenge that fair field
  
  then virtue claims from beauty beauty s red
  
  which virtue gave the golden age
  to gild 
  their silver cheeks
  and call d it then their shield
  
    teaching them thus to use it in the fight
    
    when shame assail d
  the red should fence the white
  
   
  this heraldry in lucrece  face was seen
  
  argued by beauty s red
  and virtue s white
  
  of either s colour was the other queen
  
  proving from world s minority their right
  
  yet their ambition makes them still to fight
  
    the sovereignty of either being so great
  
    that oft they interchange each other s seat
  
   
  their silent war of lilies and of roses
  
  which tarquin view d in her fair face s field
  
  in their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses
  
  where
  lest between them both it should be kill d
  
  the coward captive vanquish d doth yield 
    to those two armies that would let him go
  
    rather than triumph in so false a foe
  
   
  now thinks he that her husband s shallow tongue
  
   the niggard prodigal that prais d her so  
  in that high task hath done her beauty wrong
  
  which far exceeds his barren skill to show
  
  therefore that praise which collatine doth owe 
    enchanted tarquin answers with surmise
  
    in silent wonder of still gazing eyes
  
   
  this earthly saint
  adored by this devil
  
  little suspecteth the false worshipper
  
  for unstain d thoughts do seldom dream on evil
  
  birds never lim d no secret bushes fear
  
  so guiltless she securely gives good cheer 
    and reverend welcome to her princely guest
  
    whose inward ill no outward harm express d
  
   
  for that he colour d with his high estate
  
  hiding base sin in plaits of majesty
  
  that nothing in him seem d inordinate
  
  save sometime too much wonder of his eye
  
  which
  having all
  all could not satisfy
  
    but
  poorly rich
  so wanteth in his store
  
    that
  cloy d with much
  he pineth still for more
  
   
  but she
  that never cop d with stranger eyes
  
  could pick no meaning from their parling looks
  
  nor read the subtle shining secrecies 
  writ in the glassy margents of such books
  
  she touch d no unknown baits
  nor fear d no hooks
  
    nor could she moralize his wanton sight
  
    more than his eyes were open d to the light
  
   
  he stories to her ears her husband s fame
  
  won in the fields of fruitful italy
  
  and decks with praises collatine s high name
  
  made glorious by his manly chivalry 
  with bruised arms and wreaths of victory
  
    her joy with heav d up hand she doth express
  
    and
  wordless
  so greets heaven for his success
  
   
  far from the purpose of his coming hither
  
  he makes excuses for his being there
  
  no cloudy show of stormy blustering weather 
  doth yet in his fair welkin once appear
  
  till sable night
  mother of dread and fear
  
    upon the world dim darkness doth display
  
    and in her vaulty prison stows the day
  
   
  for then is tarquin brought unto his bed
  
  intending weariness with heavy spright
  
  for
  after supper
  long he questioned 
  with modest lucrece
  and wore out the night
  
  now leaden slumber with life s strength doth fight
  
    and every one to rest themselves betake
  
    save thieves
  and cares
  and troubled minds
  that wake
  
   
  as one of which doth tarquin lie revolving 
  the sundry dangers of his will s obtaining
  
  yet ever to obtain his will resolving
  
  though weak built hopes persuade him to abstaining
  
  despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining
  
    and when great treasure is the meed propos d
  
    though death be adjunct
  there s no death suppos d
  
   
  those that much covet are with gain so fond
  
  for what they have not
  that which they possess 
  they scatter and unloose it from their bond
  
  and so
  by hoping more
  they have but less
  
  or
  gaining more
  the profit of excess 
    is but to surfeit
  and such griefs sustain
  
    that they prove bankrupt in this poor rich gain
  
   
  the aim of all is but to nurse the life 
  with honour
  wealth
  and ease
  in waning age
  
  and in this aim there is such thwarting strife
  
  that one for all
  or all for one we gage
  
  as life for honour in fell battles  rage
  
    honour for wealth
  and oft that wealth doth cost 
    the death of all
  and all together lost
  
   
  so that in vent ring ill we leave to be 
  the things we are
  for that which we expect
  
  and this ambitious foul infirmity
  
  in having much
  torments us with defect 
  of that we have
  so then we do neglect 
    the thing we have
  and
  all for want of wit
  
    make something nothing
  by augmenting it
  
   
  such hazard now must doting tarquin make
  
  pawning his honour to obtain his lust
  
  and for himself himself he must forsake
  
  then where is truth
  if there be no self trust
  
  when shall he think to find a stranger just
  
    when he himself himself confounds
  betrays 
    to slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days
  
   
  now stole upon the time the dead of night
  
  when heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes
  
  no comfortable star did lend his light
  
  no noise but owls  and wolves  death boding cries
  
  now serves the season that they may surprise 
    the silly lambs
  pure thoughts are dead and still
  
    while lust and murder wake to stain and kill
  
   
  and now this lustful lord leap d from his bed
  
  throwing his mantle rudely o er his arm
  
  is madly toss d between desire and dread
  
  th  one sweetly flatters
  th  other feareth harm
  
  but honest fear
  bewitch d with lust s foul charm
  
    doth too too oft betake him to retire
  
    beaten away by brain sick rude desire
  
   
  his falchion on a flint he softly smiteth
  
  that from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly
  
  whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth
  
  which must be lode star to his lustful eye
  
  and to the flame thus speaks advisedly
  
     as from this cold flint i enforced this fire
  
    so lucrece must i force to my desire
   
   
  here pale with fear he doth premeditate 
  the dangers of his loathsome enterprise
  
  and in his inward mind he doth debate 
  what following sorrow may on this arise
  
  then looking scornfully
  he doth despise 
    his naked armour of still slaughter d lust
  
    and justly thus controls his thoughts unjust
  
   
   fair torch
  burn out thy light
  and lend it not 
  to darken her whose light excelleth thine
  
  and die
  unhallow d thoughts
  before you blot 
  with your uncleanness that which is divine
  
  offer pure incense to so pure a shrine
  
    let fair humanity abhor the deed 
    that spots and stains love s modest snow white weed
  
   
   o shame to knighthood and to shining arms
  
  o foul dishonour to my household s grave
  
  o impious act
  including all foul harms
  
  a martial man to be soft fancy s slave
  
  true valour still a true respect should have
  
    then my digression is so vile
  so base
  
    that it will live engraven in my face
  
   
   yea
  though i die
  the scandal will survive
  
  and be an eye sore in my golden coat
  
  some loathsome dash the herald will contrive
  
  to cipher me how fondly i did dote
  
  that my posterity
  sham d with the note
  
    shall curse my bones
  and hold it for no sin 
    to wish that i their father had not been
  
   
   what win i
  if i gain the thing i seek
  
  a dream
  a breath
  a froth of fleeting joy
  
  who buys a minute s mirth to wail a week
  
  or sells eternity to get a toy
  
  for one sweet grape who will the vine destroy
  
    or what fond beggar
  but to touch the crown
  
    would with the sceptre straight be strucken down
  
   
   if collatinus dream of my intent
  
  will he not wake
  and in a desperate rage 
  post hither
  this vile purpose to prevent
  
  this siege that hath engirt his marriage
  
  this blur to youth
  this sorrow to the sage
  
    this dying virtue
  this surviving shame
  
    whose crime will bear an ever during blame
  
   
   o
  what excuse can my invention make 
  when thou shalt charge me with so black a deed
  
  will not my tongue be mute
  my frail joints shake
  
  mine eyes forego their light
  my false heart bleed
  
  the guilt being great
  the fear doth still exceed
  
    and extreme fear can neither fight nor fly
  
    but
  coward like
  with trembling terror die
  
   
   had collatinus kill d my son or sire
  
  or lain in ambush to betray my life
  
  or were he not my dear friend
  this desire 
  might have excuse to work upon his wife
  
  as in revenge or quittal of such strife
  
    but as he is my kinsman
  my dear friend
  
    the shame and fault finds no excuse nor end
  
   
   shameful it is
   ay
  if the fact be known
  
  hateful it is
    there is no hate in loving
  
  i ll beg her love
   but she is not her own
  
  the worst is but denial and reproving
  
  my will is strong
  past reason s weak removing
  
    who fears a sentence or an old man s saw 
    shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe
   
   
  thus
  graceless
  holds he disputation 
   tween frozen conscience and hot burning will
  
  and with good thoughts makes dispensation
  
  urging the worser sense for vantage still
  
  which in a moment doth confound and kill 
    all pure effects
  and doth so far proceed
  
    that what is vile shows like a virtuous deed
  
   
  quoth he
   she took me kindly by the hand
  
  and gaz d for tidings in my eager eyes
  
  fearing some hard news from the warlike band
  
  where her beloved collatinus lies
  
  o how her fear did make her colour rise
  
    first red as roses that on lawn we lay
  
    then white as lawn
  the roses took away
  
   
   and how her hand
  in my hand being lock d
  
  forc d it to tremble with her loyal fear
  
  which struck her sad
  and then it faster rock d
  
  until her husband s welfare she did hear
  
  whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer
  
    that had narcissus seen her as she stood
  
    self love had never drown d him in the flood
  
   
   why hunt i then for colour or excuses
  
  all orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth
  
  poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses
  
  love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth
  
  affection is my captain
  and he leadeth
  
    and when his gaudy banner is display d
  
    the coward fights and will not be dismay d
  
   
   then
  childish fear
  avaunt
  debating
  die
  
  respect and reason wait on wrinkled age
  
  my heart shall never countermand mine eye
  
  sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage
  
  my part is youth
  and beats these from the stage
  
    desire my pilot is
  beauty my prize
  
    then who fears sinking where such treasure lies
   
   
  as corn o ergrown by weeds
  so heedful fear 
  is almost chok d by unresisted lust
  
  away he steals with opening
  listening ear
  
  full of foul hope
  and full of fond mistrust
  
  both which
  as servitors to the unjust
  
    so cross him with their opposite persuasion
  
    that now he vows a league
  and now invasion
  
   
  within his thought her heavenly image sits
  
  and in the self same seat sits collatine
  
  that eye which looks on her confounds his wits
  
  that eye which him beholds
  as more divine
  
  unto a view so false will not incline
  
    but with a pure appeal seeks to the heart
  
    which once corrupted takes the worser part
  
   
  and therein heartens up his servile powers
  
  who
  flatter d by their leader s jocund show
  
  stuff up his lust
  as minutes fill up hours
  
  and as their captain
  so their pride doth grow
  
  paying more slavish tribute than they owe
  
    by reprobate desire thus madly led
  
    the roman lord marcheth to lucrece  bed
  
   
  the locks between her chamber and his will
  
  each one by him enforc d retires his ward
  
  but
  as they open they all rate his ill
  
  which drives the creeping thief to some regard
  
  the threshold grates the door to have him heard
  
    night wand ring weasels shriek to see him there
  
    they fright him
  yet he still pursues his fear
  
   
  as each unwilling portal yields him way
  
  through little vents and crannies of the place 
  the wind wars with his torch
  to make him stay
  
  and blows the smoke of it into his face
  
  extinguishing his conduct in this case
  
    but his hot heart
  which fond desire doth scorch
  
    puffs forth another wind that fires the torch
  
   
  and being lighted
  by the light he spies 
  lucretia s glove
  wherein her needle sticks
  
  he takes it from the rushes where it lies
  
  and griping it
  the neeld his finger pricks
  
  as who should say this glove to wanton tricks 
    is not inur d
  return again in haste
  
    thou see st our mistress  ornaments are chaste
  
   
  but all these poor forbiddings could not stay him
  
  he in the worst sense construes their denial
  
  the doors
  the wind
  the glove that did delay him
  
  he takes for accidental things of trial
  
  or as those bars which stop the hourly dial
  
    who with a lingering stay his course doth let
  
    till every minute pays the hour his debt
  
   
   so
  so
   quoth he
   these lets attend the time
  
  like little frosts that sometime threat the spring
  
  to add a more rejoicing to the prime
  
  and give the sneaped birds more cause to sing
  
  pain pays the income of each precious thing
  
    huge rocks
  high winds
  strong pirates
  shelves and sands
  
    the merchant fears
  ere rich at home he lands
   
   
  now is he come unto the chamber door
  
  that shuts him from the heaven of his thought
  
  which with a yielding latch
  and with no more
  
  hath barr d him from the blessed thing he sought
  
  so from himself impiety hath wrought
  
    that for his prey to pray he doth begin
  
    as if the heavens should countenance his sin
  
   
  but in the midst of his unfruitful prayer
  
  having solicited the eternal power
  
  that his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair
  
  and they would stand auspicious to the hour
  
  even there he starts
   quoth he
   i must de flower
  
    the powers to whom i pray abhor this fact
  
    how can they then assist me in the act
  
   
   then love and fortune be my gods
  my guide
  
  my will is back d with resolution
  
  thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried
  
  the blackest sin is clear d with absolution
  
  against love s fire fear s frost hath dissolution
  
    the eye of heaven is out
  and misty night 
    covers the shame that follows sweet delight
   
   
  this said
  his guilty hand pluck d up the latch
  
  and with his knee the door he opens wide
  
  the dove sleeps fast that this night owl will catch
  
  thus treason works ere traitors be espied
  
  who sees the lurking serpent steps aside
  
    but she
  sound sleeping
  fearing no such thing
  
    lies at the mercy of his mortal sting
  
   
  into the chamber wickedly he stalks
  
  and gazeth on her yet unstained bed
  
  the curtains being close
  about he walks
  
  rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head
  
  by their high treason is his heart misled
  
    which gives the watch word to his hand full soon 
    to draw the cloud that hides the silver moon
  
   
  look
  as the fair and fiery pointed sun
  
  rushing from forth a cloud
  bereaves our sight
  
  even so
  the curtain drawn
  his eyes begun 
  to wink
  being blinded with a greater light
  
  whether it is that she reflects so bright
  
    that dazzleth them
  or else some shame supposed
  
    but blind they are
  and keep themselves enclosed
  
   
  o
  had they in that darksome prison died
  
  then had they seen the period of their ill
  
  then collatine again by lucrece  side 
  in his clear bed might have reposed still
  
  but they must ope
  this blessed league to kill
  
    and holy thoughted lucrece to their sight 
    must sell her joy
  her life
  her world s delight
  
   
  her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under
  
  cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss
  
  who
  therefore angry
  seems to part in sunder
  
  swelling on either side to want his bliss
  
  between whose hills her head entombed is
  
    where
  like a virtuous monument
  she lies
  
    to be admir d of lewd unhallow d eyes
  
   
  without the bed her other fair hand was
  
  on the green coverlet
  whose perfect white 
  show d like an april daisy on the grass
  
  with pearly sweat
  resembling dew of night
  
  her eyes
  like marigolds
  had sheath d their light
  
    and canopied in darkness sweetly lay
  
    till they might open to adorn the day
  
   
  her hair
  like golden threads
  play d with her breath
  
  o modest wantons
  wanton modesty
  
  showing life s triumph in the map of death
  
  and death s dim look in life s mortality
  
  each in her sleep themselves so beautify
  
    as if between them twain there were no strife
  
    but that life liv d in death
  and death in life
  
   
  her breasts
  like ivory globes circled with blue
  
  a pair of maiden worlds unconquered
  
  save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew
  
  and him by oath they truly honoured
  
  these worlds in tarquin new ambition bred
  
    who
  like a foul usurper
  went about 
    from this fair throne to heave the owner out
  
   
  what could he see but mightily he noted
  
  what did he note but strongly he desir d
  
  what he beheld
  on that he firmly doted
  
  and in his will his wilful eye he tir d
  
  with more than admiration he admir d 
    her azure veins
  her alabaster skin
  
    her coral lips
  her snow white dimpled chin
  
   
  as the grim lion fawneth o er his prey
  
  sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied
  
  so o er this sleeping soul doth tarquin stay
  
  his rage of lust by grazing qualified
  
  slack d
  not suppress d
  for standing by her side
  
    his eye
  which late this mutiny restrains
  
    unto a greater uproar tempts his veins
  
   
  and they
  like straggling slaves for pillage fighting
  
  obdurate vassals
  fell exploits effecting
  
  in bloody death and ravishment delighting
  
  nor children s tears nor mothers  groans respecting
  
  swell in their pride
  the onset still expecting
  
    anon his beating heart
  alarum striking
  
    gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking
  
   
  his drumming heart cheers up his burning eye
  
  his eye commends the leading to his hand
  
  his hand
  as proud of such a dignity
  
  smoking with pride
  march d on to make his stand 
  on her bare breast
  the heart of all her land
  
    whose ranks of blue veins
  as his hand did scale
  
    left their round turrets destitute and pale
  
   
  they
  mustering to the quiet cabinet 
  where their dear governess and lady lies
  
  do tell her she is dreadfully beset
  
  and fright her with confusion of their cries
  
  she
  much amaz d
  breaks ope her lock d up eyes
  
    who
  peeping forth this tumult to behold
  
    are by his flaming torch dimm d and controll d
  
   
  imagine her as one in dead of night 
  from forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking
  
  that thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite
  
  whose grim aspect sets every joint a shaking
  
  what terror  tis
  but she
  in worser taking
  
    from sleep disturbed
  heedfully doth view 
    the sight which makes supposed terror true
  
   
  wrapp d and confounded in a thousand fears
  
  like to a new kill d bird she trembling lies
  
  she dares not look
  yet
  winking
  there appears 
  quick shifting antics
  ugly in her eyes
  
  such shadows are the weak brain s forgeries
  
    who
  angry that the eyes fly from their lights
  
    in darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights
  
   
  his hand
  that yet remains upon her breast
  
   rude ram
  to batter such an ivory wall
   
  may feel her heart
  poor citizen
  distress d
  
  wounding itself to death
  rise up and fall
  
  beating her bulk
  that his hand shakes withal
  
    this moves in him more rage
  and lesser pity
  
    to make the breach
  and enter this sweet city
  
   
  first
  like a trumpet
  doth his tongue begin 
  to sound a parley to his heartless foe
  
  who o er the white sheet peers her whiter chin
  
  the reason of this rash alarm to know
  
  which he by dumb demeanour seeks to show
  
    but she with vehement prayers urgeth still 
    under what colour he commits this ill
  
   
  thus he replies
   the colour in thy face
  
   that even for anger makes the lily pale
  
  and the red rose blush at her own disgrace  
  shall plead for me and tell my loving tale
  
  under that colour am i come to scale 
    thy never conquer d fort
  the fault is thine
  
    for those thine eyes betray thee unto mine
  
   
   thus i forestall thee
  if thou mean to chide
  
  thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night
  
  where thou with patience must my will abide
  
  my will that marks thee for my earth s delight
  
  which i to conquer sought with all my might
  
    but as reproof and reason beat it dead
  
    by thy bright beauty was it newly bred
  
   
   i see what crosses my attempt will bring
  
  i know what thorns the growing rose defends
  
  i think the honey guarded with a sting
  
  all this
  beforehand
  counsel comprehends
  
  but will is deaf
  and hears no heedful friends
  
    only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty
  
    and dotes on what he looks
   gainst law or duty
  
   
   i have debated
  even in my soul
  
  what wrong
  what shame
  what sorrow i shall breed
  
  but nothing can affection s course control
  
  or stop the headlong fury of his speed
  
  i know repentant tears ensue the deed
  
    reproach
  disdain
  and deadly enmity
  
    yet strike i to embrace mine infamy
   
   
  this said
  he shakes aloft his roman blade
  
  which
  like a falcon towering in the skies
  
  coucheth the fowl below with his wings  shade
  
  whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies
  
  so under his insulting falchion lies 
    harmless lucretia
  marking what he tells 
    with trembling fear
  as fowl hear falcon s bells
  
   
   lucrece
   quoth he
   this night i must enjoy thee
  
  if thou deny
  then force must work my way
  
  for in thy bed i purpose to destroy thee
  
  that done
  some worthless slave of thine i ll slay
  
  to kill thine honour with thy life s decay
  
    and in thy dead arms do i mean to place him
  
    swearing i slew him
  seeing thee embrace him
  
   
   so thy surviving husband shall remain 
  the scornful mark of every open eye
  
  thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain
  
  thy issue blurr d with nameless bastardy
  
  and thou
  the author of their obloquy
  
    shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes
  
     and sung by children in succeeding times
  
   
   but if thou yield
  i rest thy secret friend
  
  the fault unknown is as a thought unacted
  
  a little harm
  done to a great good end
  
  for lawful policy remains enacted
  
  the poisonous simple sometimes is compacted 
    in a pure compound
  being so applied
  
    his venom in effect is purified
  
   
   then
  for thy husband and thy children s sake
  
  tender my suit
  bequeath not to their lot 
  the shame that from them no device can take
  
  the blemish that will never be forgot
  
  worse than a slavish wipe
  or birth hour s blot
  
    for marks descried in men s nativity 
    are nature s faults
  not their own infamy
   
   
  here with a cockatrice  dead killing eye 
  he rouseth up himself and makes a pause
  
  while she
  the picture of pure piety
  
  like a white hind under the grype s sharp claws
  
  pleads in a wilderness where are no laws
  
    to the rough beast that knows no gentle right
  
    nor aught obeys but his foul appetite
  
   
  but when a black fac d cloud the world doth threat
  
  in his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding
  
  from earth s dark womb some gentle gust doth get
  
  which blows these pitchy vapours from their biding
  
  hindering their present fall by this dividing
  
    so his unhallow d haste her words delays
  
    and moody pluto winks while orpheus plays
  
   
  yet
  foul night working cat
  he doth but dally
  
  while in his hold fast foot the weak mouse panteth
  
  her sad behaviour feeds his vulture folly
  
  a swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth
  
  his ear her prayers admits
  but his heart granteth 
    no penetrable entrance to her plaining
  
    tears harden lust
  though marble wear with raining
  
   
  her pity pleading eyes are sadly fix d 
  in the remorseless wrinkles of his face
  
  her modest eloquence with sighs is mix d
  
  which to her oratory adds more grace
  
  she puts the period often from his place
  
    and midst the sentence so her accent breaks
  
    that twice she doth begin ere once she speaks
  
   
  she conjures him by high almighty jove
  
  by knighthood
  gentry
  and sweet friendship s oath
  
  by her untimely tears
  her husband s love
  
  by holy human law
  and common troth
  
  by heaven and earth
  and all the power of both
  
    that to his borrow d bed he make retire
  
    and stoop to honour
  not to foul desire
  
   
  quoth she
   reward not hospitality 
  with such black payment as thou hast pretended
  
  mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee
  
  mar not the thing that cannot be amended
  
  end thy ill aim before the shoot be ended
  
    he is no woodman that doth bend his bow 
    to strike a poor unseasonable doe
  
   
   my husband is thy friend
  for his sake spare me
  
  thyself art mighty
  for thine own sake leave me
  
  myself a weakling
  do not then ensnare me
  
  thou look st not like deceit
  do not deceive me
  
  my sighs
  like whirlwinds
  labour hence to heave thee
  
    if ever man were mov d with woman s moans
  
    be moved with my tears
  my sighs
  my groans
  
   
   all which together
  like a troubled ocean
  
  beat at thy rocky and wreck threatening heart
  
  to soften it with their continual motion
  
  for stones dissolv d to water do convert
  
  o
  if no harder than a stone thou art
  
    melt at my tears
  and be compassionate
  
    soft pity enters at an iron gate
  
   
   in tarquin s likeness i did entertain thee
  
  hast thou put on his shape to do him shame
  
  to all the host of heaven i complain me
  
  thou wrong st his honour
  wound st his princely name
  
  thou art not what thou seem st
  and if the same
  
    thou seem st not what thou art
  a god
  a king
  
    for kings like gods should govern every thing
  
   
   how will thy shame be seeded in thine age
  
  when thus thy vices bud before thy spring
  
  if in thy hope thou dar st do such outrage
  
  what dar st thou not when once thou art a king
  
  o
  be remember d
  no outrageous thing 
    from vassal actors can he wip d away
  
    then kings  misdeeds cannot be hid in clay
  
   
   this deed will make thee only lov d for fear
  
  but happy monarchs still are fear d for love
  
  with foul offenders thou perforce must bear
  
  when they in thee the like offences prove
  
  if but for fear of this
  thy will remove
  
    for princes are the glass
  the school
  the book
  
    where subjects eyes do learn
  do read
  do look
  
   
   and wilt thou be the school where lust shall learn
  
  must he in thee read lectures of such shame
  
  wilt thou be glass
  wherein it shall discern 
  authority for sin
  warrant for blame
  
  to privilege dishonour in thy name
  
    thou back st reproach against long living laud
  
    and mak st fair reputation but a bawd
  
   
   hast thou command
  by him that gave it thee
  
  from a pure heart command thy rebel will
  
  draw not thy sword to guard iniquity
  
  for it was lent thee all that brood to kill
  
  thy princely office how canst thou fulfill
  
    when
  pattern d by thy fault
  foul sin may say 
    he learn d to sin
  and thou didst teach the way
  
   
   think but how vile a spectacle it were 
  to view thy present trespass in another
  
  men s faults do seldom to themselves appear
  
  their own transgressions partially they smother
  
  this guilt would seem death worthy in thy brother
  
    o how are they wrapp d in with infamies 
    that from their own misdeeds askaunce their eyes
  
   
   to thee
  to thee
  my heav d up hands appeal
  
  not to seducing lust
  thy rash relier
  
  i sue for exil d majesty s repeal
  
  let him return
  and flattering thoughts retire
  
  his true respect will  prison false desire
  
    and wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne
  
    that thou shalt see thy state
  and pity mine
   
   
   have done
   quoth he
   my uncontrolled tide 
  turns not
  but swells the higher by this let
  
  small lights are soon blown out
  huge fires abide
  
  and with the wind in greater fury fret
  
  the petty streams that pay a daily debt 
    to their salt sovereign
  with their fresh falls  haste
  
    add to his flow
  but alter not his taste
   
   
   thou art
   quoth she
   a sea
  a sovereign king
  
  and
  lo
  there falls into thy boundless flood 
  black lust
  dishonour
  shame
  misgoverning
  
  who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood
  
  if all these petty ills shall change thy good
  
    thy sea within a puddle s womb is hears d
  
    and not the puddle in thy sea dispers d
  
   
   so shall these slaves be king
  and thou their slave
  
  thou nobly base
  they basely dignified
  
  thou their fair life
  and they thy fouler grave
  
  thou loathed in their shame
  they in thy pride
  
  the lesser thing should not the greater hide
  
    the cedar stoops not to the base shrub s foot
  
    but low shrubs whither at the cedar s root
  
   
   so let thy thoughts
  low vassals to thy state    
   no more
   quoth he
   by heaven
  i will not hear thee
  
  yield to my love
  if not
  enforced hate
  
  instead of love s coy touch
  shall rudely tear thee
  
  that done
  despitefully i mean to bear thee 
    unto the base bed of some rascal groom
  
    to be thy partner in this shameful doom
   
   
  this said
  he sets his foot upon the light
  
  for light and lust are deadly enemies
  
  shame folded up in blind concealing night
  
  when most unseen
  then most doth tyrannize
  
  the wolf hath seiz d his prey
  the poor lamb cries
  
    till with her own white fleece her voice controll d 
    entombs her outcry in her lips  sweet fold
  
   
  for with the nightly linen that she wears 
  he pens her piteous clamours in her head
  
  cooling his hot face in the chastest tears 
  that ever modest eyes with sorrow shed
  
  o
  that prone lust should stain so pure a bed
  
    the spots whereof could weeping purify
  
    her tears should drop on them perpetually
  
   
  but she hath lost a dearer thing than life
  
  and he hath won what he would lose again
  
  this forced league doth force a further strife
  
  this momentary joy breeds months of pain
  
  this hot desire converts to cold disdain
  
    pure chastity is rifled of her store
  
    and lust
  the thief
  far poorer than before
  
   
  look
  as the full fed hound or gorged hawk
  
  unapt for tender smell or speedy flight
  
  make slow pursuit
  or altogether balk 
  the prey wherein by nature they delight
  
  so surfeit taking tarquin fares this night
  
    his taste delicious
  in digestion souring
  
    devours his will
  that liv d by foul devouring
  
   
  o deeper sin than bottomless conceit 
  can comprehend in still imagination
  
  drunken desire must vomit his receipt
  
  ere he can see his own abomination
  
  while lust is in his pride no exclamation 
    can curb his heat
  or rein his rash desire
  
    till
  like a jade
  self will himself doth tire
  
   
  and then with lank and lean discolour d cheek
  
  with heavy eye
  knit brow
  and strengthless pace
  
  feeble desire
  all recreant
  poor
  and meek
  
  like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case
  
  the flesh being proud
  desire doth fight with grace
  
    for there it revels
  and when that decays
  
    the guilty rebel for remission prays
  
   
  so fares it with this faultful lord of rome
  
  who this accomplishment so hotly chas d
  
  for now against himself he sounds this doom
  
  that through the length of times he stands disgrac d
  
  besides
  his soul s fair temple is defac d
  
    to whose weak ruins muster troops of cares
  
    to ask the spotted princess how she fares
  
   
  she says
  her subjects with foul insurrection 
  have batter d down her consecrated wall
  
  and by their mortal fault brought in subjection 
  her immortality
  and made her thrall 
  to living death
  and pain perpetual
  
    which in her prescience she controlled still
  
    but her foresight could not forestall their will
  
   
  even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth
  
  a captive victor that hath lost in gain
  
  bearing away the wound that nothing healeth
  
  the scar that will
  despite of cure
  remain
  
  leaving his spoil perplex d in greater pain
  
    she hears the load of lust he left behind
  
    and he the burthen of a guilty mind
  
   
  he like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence
  
  she like a wearied lamb lies panting there
  
  he scowls
  and hates himself for his offence
  
  she
  desperate
  with her nails her flesh doth tear
  
  he faintly flies
  sweating with guilty fear
  
    she stays
  exclaiming on the direful night
  
    he runs
  and chides his vanish d
  loath d delight
  
   
  he thence departs a heavy convertite
  
  she there remains a hopeless castaway
  
  he in his speed looks for the morning light
  
  she prays she never may behold the day
  
   for day
   quoth she
   night s scapes doth open lay
  
    and my true eyes have never practis d how 
    to cloak offences with a cunning brow
  
   
   they think not but that every eye can see 
  the same disgrace which they themselves behold
  
  and therefore would they still in darkness be
  
  to have their unseen sin remain untold
  
  for they their guilt with weeping will unfold
  
    and grave
  like water that doth eat in steel
  
    upon my cheeks what helpless shame i feel
   
   
  here she exclaims against repose and rest
  
  and bids her eyes hereafter still be blind
  
  she wakes her heart by beating on her breast
  
  and bids it leap from thence
  where it may find 
  some purer chest
  to close so pure a mind
  
    frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite 
    against the unseen secrecy of night
  
   
   o comfort killing night
  image of hell
  
  dim register and notary of shame
  
  black stage for tragedies and murders fell
  
  vast sin concealing chaos
  nurse of blame
  
  blind muffled bawd
  dark harbour for defame
  
    grim cave of death
  whispering conspirator 
    with close tongued treason and the ravisher
  
   
   o hateful
  vaporous
  and foggy night
  
  since thou art guilty of my cureless crime
  
  muster thy mists to meet the eastern light
  
  make war against proportion d course of time
  
  or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb 
    his wonted height
  yet ere he go to bed
  
    knit poisonous clouds about his golden head
  
   
   with rotten damps ravish the morning air
  
  let their exhal d unwholesome breaths make sick 
  the life of purity
  the supreme fair
  
  ere he arrive his weary noontide prick
  
  and let thy misty vapours march so thick
  
    that in their smoky ranks his smother d light 
    may set at noon and make perpetual night
  
   
   were tarquin night  as he is but night s child 
  
  the silver shining queen he would distain
  
  her twinkling handmaids too
  by him defil d
  
  through  night s  black  bosom  should not peep again
  
  so should i have co partners in my pain
  
    and fellowship in woe doth woe assuage
  
    as palmers  chat makes short their pilgrimage
  
   
   where now i have no one to blush with me
  
  to cross their arms and hang their heads with mine
  
  to mask their brows
  and hide their infamy
  
  but i alone alone must sit and pine
  
  seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine
  
    mingling my talk with tears
  my grief with groans
  
    poor wasting monuments of lasting moans
  
   
   o night
  thou furnace of foul reeking smoke
  
  let not the jealous day behold that face 
  which underneath thy black all hiding cloak 
  immodesty lies martyr d with disgrace
  
  keep still possession of thy gloomy place
  
    that all the faults which in thy reign are made
  
    may likewise be sepulchred in thy shade
  
   
   make me not object to the tell tale day
  
  the light will show
  character d in my brow
  
  the story of sweet chastity s decay
  
  the impious breach of holy wedlock vow
  
  yea
  the illiterate
  that know not how 
    to cipher what is writ in learned books
  
    will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks
  
   
   the nurse
  to still her child
  will tell my story 
  and fright her crying babe with tarquin s name
  
  the orator
  to deck his oratory
  
  will couple my reproach to tarquin s shame
  
  feast finding minstrels
  tuning my defame
  
    will tie the hearers to attend each line
  
    how tarquin wronged me
  i collatine
  
   
   let my good name
  that senseless reputation
  
  for collatine s dear love be kept unspotted
  
  if that be made a theme for disputation
  
  the branches of another root are rotted
  
  and undeserved reproach to him allotted
  
    that is as clear from this attaint of mine 
    as i
  ere this
  was pure to collatine
  
   
   o unseen shame
  invisible disgrace
  
  o unfelt sore
  crest wounding
  private scar
  
  reproach is stamp d in collatinus  face
  
  and tarquin s eye may read the mot afar
  
  how he in peace is wounded
  not in war
  
    alas
  how many bear such shameful blows
  
    which not themselves
  but he that gives them knows
  
   
   if
  collatine
  thine honour lay in me
  
  from me by strong assault it is bereft
  
  my honey lost
  and i
  a drone like bee
  
  have no perfection of my summer left
  
  but robb d and ransack d by injurious theft
  
    in thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept
  
    and suck d the honey which thy chaste bee kept
  
   
   yet am i guilty of thy honour s wrack
    
  yet for thy honour did i entertain him
  
  coming from thee
  i could not put him back
  
  for it had been dishonour to disdain him
  
  besides
  of weariness he did complain him
  
    and talk d of virtue
   o unlook d for evil
  
    when virtue is profan d in such a devil
  
   
   why should the worm intrude the maiden bud
  
  or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows  nests
  
  or toads infect fair founts with venom mud
  
  or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts
  
  or kings be breakers of their own behests
  
    but no perfection is so absolute
  
    that some impurity doth not pollute
  
   
   the aged man that coffers up his gold 
  is plagued with cramps
  and gouts
  and painful fits
  
  and scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold
  
  but like still pining tantalus he sits
  
  and useless barns the harvest of his wits
  
    having no other pleasure of his gain 
    but torment that it cannot cure his pain
  
   
   so then he hath it when he cannot use it
  
  and leaves it to be master d by his young
  
  who in their pride do presently abuse it
  
  their father was too weak
  and they too strong
  
  to hold their cursed blessed fortune long
  
    the sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
  
    even in the moment that we call them ours
  
   
   unruly blasts wait on the tender spring
  
  unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers
  
  the adder hisses where the sweet birds sing
  
  what virtue breeds iniquity devours
  
  we have no good that we can say is ours
  
    but ill annexed opportunity 
    or kills his life or else his quality
  
   
   o opportunity
  thy guilt is great
  
   tis thou that executest the traitor s treason
  
  thou set st the wolf where he the lamb may get
  
  whoever plots the sin
  thou  point st the season
  
   tis thou that spurn st at right
  at law
  at reason
  
    and in thy shady cell
  where none may spy him
  
    sits sin
  to seize the souls that wander by him
  
   
   thou mak st the vestal violate her oath
  
  thou blow st the fire when temperance is thaw d
  
  thou smother st honesty
  thou murther st troth
  
  thou foul abettor
  thou notorious bawd
  
  thou plantest scandal and displacest laud
  
    thou ravisher
  thou traitor
  thou false thief
  
    thy honey turns to gall
  thy joy to grief
  
   
   thy secret pleasure turns to open shame
  
  thy private feasting to a public fast
  
  thy smoothing titles to a ragged name
  
  thy sugar d tongue to bitter wormwood taste
  
  thy violent vanities can never last
  
    how comes it then
  vile opportunity
  
    being so bad
  such numbers seek for thee
  
   
   when wilt thou be the humble suppliant s friend
  
  and bring him where his suit may be obtain d
  
  when wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end
  
  or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain d
  
  give physic to the sick
  ease to the pain d
  
    the poor
  lame
  blind
  halt
  creep
  cry out for thee
  
    but they ne er meet with opportunity
  
   
   the patient dies while the physician sleeps
  
  the orphan pines while the oppressor feeds
  
  justice is feasting while the widow weeps
  
  advice is sporting while infection breeds
  
  thou grant st no time for charitable deeds
  
    wrath
  envy
  treason
  rape
  and murder s rages
  
    thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages
  
   
   when truth and virtue have to do with thee
  
  a thousand crosses keep them from thy aid
  
  they buy thy help
  but sin ne er gives a fee
  
  he gratis comes
  and thou art well appay d 
  as well to hear as grant what he hath said
  
    my collatine would else have come to me 
    when tarquin did
  but he was stay d by thee
  
   
   guilty thou art of murder and of theft
  
  guilty of perjury and subornation
  
  guilty of treason
  forgery
  and shift
  
  guilty of incest
  that abomination
  
  an accessory by thine inclination 
    to all sins past
  and all that are to come
  
    from the creation to the general doom
  
   
   mis shapen time
  copesmate of ugly night
  
  swift subtle post
  carrier of grisly care
  
  eater of youth
  false slave to false delight
  
  base watch of woes
  sin s pack horse
  virtue s snare
  
  thou nursest all and murtherest all that are
  
    o hear me then
  injurious
  shifting time
  
    be guilty of my death
  since of my crime
  
   
   why hath thy servant
  opportunity
  
  betray d the hours thou gav st me to repose
  
  cancell d my fortunes
  and enchained me 
  to endless date of never ending woes
  
  time s office is to fine the hate of foes
  
    to eat up errors by opinion bred
  
    not spend the dowry of a lawful bed
  
   
   time s glory is to calm contending kings
  
  to unmask falsehood
  and bring truth to light
  
  to stamp the seal of time in aged things
  
  to wake the morn
  and sentinel the night
  
  to wrong the wronger till he render right
  
    to ruinate proud buildings with thy hours
  
    and smear with dust their glittering golden towers
  
   
   to fill with worm holes stately monuments
  
  to feed oblivion with decay of things
  
  to blot old books and alter their contents
  
  to pluck the quills from ancient ravens  wings
  
  to dry the old oak s sap and cherish springs
  
    to spoil antiquities of hammer d steel
  
    and turn the giddy round of fortune s wheel
  
   
   to show the beldame daughters of her daughter
  
  to make the child a man
  the man a child
  
  to slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter
  
  to tame the unicorn and lion wild
  
  to mock the subtle
  in themselves beguil d
  
    to cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops
  
    and waste huge stones with little water drops
  
   
   why work st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage
  
  unless thou couldst return to make amends
  
  one poor retiring minute in an age 
  would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends
  
  lending him wit that to bad debtors lends
  
    o
  this dread night
  wouldst thou one hour come back
  
    i could prevent this storm
  and shun thy wrack
  
   
   thou cease
 ess lackey to eternity
  
  with some mischance cross tarquin in his flight
  
  devise extremes beyond extremity
  
  to make him curse this cursed crimeful night
  
  let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright
  
    and the dire thought of his committed evil 
    shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil
  
   
   disturb his hours of rest with restless trances
  
  afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans
  
  let there bechance him pitiful mischances
  
  to make him moan
  but pity not his moans
  
  stone him with harden d hearts
  harder than stones
  
    and let mild women to him lose their mildness
  
    wilder to him than tigers in their wildness
  
   
   let him have time to tear his curled hair
  
  let him have time against himself to rave
  
  let him have time of time s help to despair
  
  let him have time to live a loathed slave
  
  let him have time a beggar s orts to crave
  
    and time to see one that by alms doth live 
    disdain to him disdained scraps to give
  
   
   let him have time to see his friends his foes
  
  and merry fools to mock at him resort
  
  let him have time to mark how slow time goes 
  in time of sorrow
  and how swift and short 
  his time of folly and his time of sport
  
    and ever let his unrecalling crime 
    have time to wail the abusing of his time
  
   
   o time
  thou tutor both to good and bad
  
  teach me to curse him that thou taught st this ill
  
  at his own shadow let the thief run mad
  
  himself himself seek every hour to kill
  
  such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill
  
    for who so base would such an office have 
    as slanderous deathsman to so base a slave
  
   
  the baser is he
  coming from a king
  
  to shame his hope with deeds degenerate
  
  the mightier man
  the mightier is the thing 
  that makes him honour d
  or begets him hate
  
  for greatest scandal waits on greatest state
  
    the moon being clouded presently is miss d
  
    but little stars may hide them when they list
  
   
   the crow may bathe his coal black wings in mire
  
  and unperceived fly with the filth away
  
  but if the like the snow white swan desire
  
  the stain upon his silver down will stay
  
  poor grooms are sightless night
  kings glorious day
  
    gnats are unnoted wheresoe er they fly
  
    but eagles gazed upon with every eye
  
   
   out
  idle words
  servants to shallow fools
  
  unprofitable sounds
  weak arbitrators
  
  busy yourselves in skill contending schools
  
  debate where leisure serves with dull debaters
  
  to trembling clients be you mediators
  
    for me
  i force not argument a straw
  
    since that my case is past the help of law
  
   
   in vain i rail at opportunity
  
  at time
  at tarquin
  and uncheerful night
  
  in vain i cavil with mine infamy
  
  in vain i spurn at my confirm d despite
  
  this helpless smoke of words doth me no right
  
    the remedy indeed to do me good 
    is to let forth my foul defil d blood
  
   
   poor hand
  why quiver st thou at this decree
  
  honour thyself to rid me of this shame
  
  for if i die
  my honour lives in thee
  
  but if i live
  thou livest in my defame
  
  since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame
  
    and wast afear d to scratch her wicked foe
  
    kill both thyself and her for yielding so
   
   
  this said
  from her be tumbled couch she starteth
  
  to find some desperate instrument of death
  
  but this no slaughter house no tool imparteth
  
  to make more vent for passage of her breath
  
  which
  thronging through her lips
  so vanisheth 
    as smoke from aetna
  that in air consumes
  
    or that which from discharged cannon fumes
  
   
   in vain
   quoth she
   i live
  and seek in vain 
  some happy mean to end a hapless life
  
  i fear d by tarquin s falchion to be slain
  
  yet for the self same purpose seek a knife
  
  but when i fear d i was a loyal wife
  
    so am i now
   o no
  that cannot be
  
    of that true type hath tarquin rifled me
  
   
   o
  that is gone for which i sought to live
  
  and therefore now i need not fear to die
  
  to clear this spot by death
  at least i give 
  a badge of fame to slander s livery
  
  a dying life to living infamy
  
    poor helpless help
  the treasure stolen away
  
    to burn the guiltless casket where it lay
  
   
   well
  well
  dear collatine
  thou shalt not know 
  the stained taste of violated troth
  
  i will not wrong thy true affection so
  
  to flatter thee with an infringed oath
  
  this bastard graff shall never come to growth
  
    he shall not boast who did thy stock pollute 
    that thou art doting father of his fruit
  
   
  nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought
  
  nor laugh with his companions at thy state
  
  but thou shalt know thy interest was not bought 
  basely with gold
  but stolen from forth thy gate
  
  for me
  i am the mistress of my fate
  
    and with my trespass never will dispense
  
    till life to death acquit my forced offence
  
   
   i will not poison thee with my attaint
  
  nor fold my fault in cleanly coin d excuses
  
  my sable ground of sin i will not paint
  
  to hide the truth of this false night s abuses
  
  my tongue shall utter all
  mine eyes
  like sluices
  
    as from a mountain spring that feeds a dale
  
    shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale
   
   
  by this
  lamenting philomel had ended 
  the well tun d warble of her nightly sorrow
  
  and solemn night with slow sad gait descended 
  to ugly hell
  when
  lo
  the blushing morrow 
  lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow
  
    but cloudy lucrece shames herself to see
  
    and therefore still in night would cloister d be
  
   
  revealing day through every cranny spies
  
  and seems to point her out where she sits weeping
  
  to whom she sobbing speaks
   o eye of eyes
  
  why pryest thou through my window
  leave thy peeping
  
  mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping
  
    brand not my forehead with thy piercing light
  
    for day hath nought to do what s done by night
   
   
  thus cavils she with every thing she sees
  
  true grief is fond and testy as a child
  
  who wayward once
  his mood with nought agrees
  
  old woes
  not infant sorrows
  bear them mild
  
  continuance tames the one
  the other wild
  
    like an unpractis d swimmer plunging still 
    with too much labour drowns for want of skill
  
   
  so she
  deep drenched in a sea of care
  
  holds disputation with each thing she views
  
  and to herself all sorrow doth compare
  
  no object but her passion s strength renews
  
  and as one shifts
  another straight ensues
  
    sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words
  
    sometime  tis mad
  and too much talk affords
  
   
  the little birds that tune their morning s joy 
  make her moans mad with their sweet melody
  
  for mirth doth search the bottom of annoy
  
  sad souls are slain in merry company
  
  grief best is pleas d with grief s society
  
    true sorrow then is feelingly suffic d 
    when with like semblance it is sympathiz d
  
   
   tis double death to drown in ken of shore
  
  he ten times pines that pines beholding food
  
  to see the salve doth make the wound ache more
  
  great grief grieves most at that would do it good
  
  deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood
  
    who
  being stopp d
  the bounding banks o erflows
  
    grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows
  
   
   you mocking birds
   quoth she
   your tunes entomb 
  within your hollow swelling feather d breasts
  
  and in my hearing be you mute and dumb
  
   my restless discord loves no stops nor rests
  
  a woeful hostess brooks not merry guests
   
    relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears
  
    distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears
  
   
   come
  philomel
  that sing st of ravishment
  
  make thy sad grove in my dishevell d hair
  
  as the dank earth weeps at thy languishment
  
  so i at each sad strain will strain a tear
  
  and with deep groans the diapason bear
  
    for burthen wise i ll hum on tarquin still
  
    while thou on tereus descant st better skill
  
   
   and whiles against a thorn thou bear st thy part
  
  to keep thy sharp woes waking
  wretched i
  
  to imitate thee well
  against my heart 
  will fix a sharp knife
  to affright mine eye
  
  who
  if it wink
  shall thereon fall and die
  
    these means
  as frets upon an instrument
  
    shall tune our heart strings to true languishment
  
   
   and for
  poor bird
  thou sing st not in the day
  
  as shaming any eye should thee behold
  
  some dark deep desert
  seated from the way
  
  that knows not parching heat nor freezing cold
  
  will we find out
  and there we will unfold 
    to creatures stern sad tunes
  to change their kinds
  
    since men prove beasts
  let beasts bear gentle minds
   
   
  as the poor frighted deer
  that stands at gaze
  
  wildly determining which way to fly
  
  or one encompass d with a winding maze
  
  that cannot tread the way out readily
  
  so with herself is she in mutiny
  
    to live or die which of the twain were better
  
    when life is sham d
  and death reproach s debtor
  
   
   to kill myself
   quoth she
   alack
  what were it
  
  but with my body my poor soul s pollution
  
  they that lose half with greater patience bear it 
  than they whose whole is swallow d in confusion
  
  that mother tries a merciless conclusion 
    who
  having two sweet babes
  when death takes one
  
    will slay the other
  and be nurse to none
  
   
   my body or my soul
  which was the dearer
  
  when the one pure
  the other made divine
  
  whose love of either to myself was nearer
  
  when both were kept for heaven and collatine
  
  ah
  me
  the bark peel d from the lofty pine
  
    his leaves will wither
  and his sap decay
  
    so must my soul
  her bark being peel d away
  
   
   her house is sack d
  her quiet interrupted
  
  her mansion batter d by the enemy
  
  her sacred temple spotted
  spoil d
  corrupted
  
  grossly engirt with daring infamy
  
  then let it not be call d impiety
  
    if in this blemish d fort i make some hole 
    through which i may convey this troubled soul
  
   
   yet die i will not till my collatine 
  have heard the cause of my untimely death
  
  that he may vow
  in that sad hour of mine
  
  revenge on him that made me stop my breath
  
  my stained blood to tarquin i ll bequeath
  
    which by him tainted shall for him be spent
  
    and as his due writ in my testament
  
   
   my honour i ll bequeath unto the knife 
  that wounds my body so dishonoured
  
   tis honour to deprive dishonour d life
  
  the one will live
  the other being dead
  
  so of shame s ashes shall my fame be bred
  
    for in my death i murther shameful scorn
  
    my shame so dead
  mine honour is new born
  
   
   dear lord of that dear jewel i have lost
  
  what legacy shall i bequeath to thee
  
  my resolution
  love
  shall be thy boast
  
  by whose example thou reveng d mayst be
  
  how tarquin must be used
  read it in me
  
    myself
  thy friend
  will kill myself
  thy foe
  
    and
  for my sake
  serve thou false tarquin so
  
   
   this brief abridgement of my will i make
  
  my soul and body to the skies and ground
  
  my resolution
  husband
  do thou take
  
  mine honour be the knife s that makes my wound
  
  my shame be his that did my fame confound
  
    and all my fame that lives disburs d be 
    to those that live
  and think no shame of me
  
   
   thou
  collatine
  shalt oversee this will
  
  how was i overseen that thou shalt see it
  
  my blood shall wash the slander of mine ill
  
  my life s foul deed my life s fair end shall free it
  
  faint not
  faint heart
  but stoutly say 
 so be it
 
  
    yield to my hand
  my hand shall conquer thee
  
    thou dead
  both die
  and both shall victors be
   
   
  this plot of death when sadly she had laid
  
  and wip d the brinish pearl from her bright eyes
  
  with untun d tongue she hoarsely call d her maid
  
  whose swift obedience to her mistress hies
  
  for fleet wing d duty with thought s feathers flies
  
    poor lucrece  cheeks unto her maid seem so 
    as winter meads when sun doth melt their snow
  
   
  her mistress she doth give demure good morrow
  
  with soft slow tongue
  true mark of modesty
  
  and sorts a sad look to her lady s sorrow
  
   for why her face wore sorrow s livery
   
  but durst not ask of her audaciously 
    why her two suns were cloud eclipsed so
  
    nor why her fair cheeks over wash d with woe
  
   
  but as the earth doth weep
  the sun being set
  
  each flower moisten d like a melting eye
  
  even so the maid with swelling drops  gan wet 
  her circled eyne
  enforc d by sympathy 
  of those fair suns
  set in her mistress  sky
  
    who in a salt wav d ocean quench their light
  
    which makes the maid weep like the dewy night
  
   
  a pretty while these pretty creatures stand
  
  like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling
  
  one justly weeps
  the other takes in hand 
  no cause
  but company
  of her drops spilling
  
  their gentle sex to weep are often willing
  
    grieving themselves to guess at others  smarts
  
    and then they drown their eyes or break their hearts
  
   
  for men have marble
  women waxen minds
  
  and therefore are they form d as marble will
  
  the weak oppress d
  the impression of strange kinds 
  is form d in them by force
  by fraud
  or skill
  
  then call them not the authors of their ill
  
    no more than wax shall be accounted evil
  
    wherein is stamp d the semblance of a devil
  
   
  their smoothness
  like a goodly champaign plain
  
  lays open all the little worms that creep
  
  in men
  as in a rough grown grove
  remain 
  cave keeping evils that obscurely sleep
  
  through crystal walls each little mote will peep
  
    though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks
  
    poor women s faces are their own faults  books
  
   
  no man inveigb against the wither d flower
  
  but chide rough winter that the flower hath kill d
  
  not that devour d
  but that which doth devour
  
  is worthy blame
   o
  let it not be hild 
  poor women s faults
  that they are so fulfill d 
    with men s abuses
  those proud lords
  to blame
  
    make weak made women tenants to their shame
  
   
  the precedent whereof in lucrece view
  
  assail d by night with circumstances strong 
  of present death
  and shame that might ensue 
  by that her death
  to do her husband wrong
  
  such danger to resistance did belong
  
    the dying fear through all her body spread
  
    and who cannot abuse a body dead
  
   
  by this
  mild patience bid fair lucrece speak 
  to the poor counterfeit of her complaining
  
   my girl
   quoth she
   on what occasion break 
  those tears from thee
  that down thy cheeks are raining
  
  if thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining
  
    know
  gentle wench
  it small avails my mood
  
    if tears could help
  mine own would do me good
  
   
   but tell me
  girl
  when went    and there she stay d 
  till after a deep groan   tarquin from
  hence
   
   madam
  ere i was up
   replied the maid
  
   the more to blame my sluggard negligence
  
  yet with the fault i thus far can dispense
  
    myself was stirring ere the break of day
  
    and
  ere i rose
  was tarquin gone away
  
   
   but
  lady
  if your maid may be so bold
  
  she would request to know your heaviness
   
   o peace
   quoth lucrece
   if it should be told
  
  the repetition cannot make it less
  
  for more it is than i can well express
  
    and that deep torture may be call d a hell
  
    when more is felt than one hath power to tell
  
   
   go
  get me hither paper
  ink
  and pen   
  yet save that labour
  for i have them here
  
  what should i say
   one of my husband s men 
  bid thou be ready
  by and by
  to bear 
  a letter to my lord
  my love
  my dear
  
    bid him with speed prepare to carry it
  
    the cause craves haste
  and it will soon be writ
   
   
  her maid is gone
  and she prepares to write
  
  first hovering o er the paper with her quill
  
  conceit and grief an eager combat fight
  
  what wit sets down is blotted straight with will
  
  this is too curious good
  this blunt and ill
  
    much like a press of people at a door
  
    throng her inventions
  which shall go before
  
   
  at last she thus begins
    thou worthy lord 
  of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee
  
  health to thy person
  next vouchsafe to afford 
   if ever
  love
  thy lucrece thou wilt see  
  some present speed to come and visit me
  
    so
  i commend me from our house in grief
  
    my woes are tedious
  though my words are brief
   
   
  here folds she up the tenor of her woe
  
  her certain sorrow writ uncertainly
  
  by this short schedule collatine may know 
  her grief
  but not her grief s true quality
  
  she dares not thereof make discovery
  
    lest he should hold it her own gross abuse
  
    ere she with blood had stain d her stain d excuse
  
   
  besides
  the life and feeling of her passion 
  she hoards
  to spend when he is by to hear her
  
  when sighs
  and groans
  and tears may grace the fashion 
  of her disgrace
  the better so to clear her 
  from that suspicion which the world my might bear her
  
    to shun this blot
  she would not blot the letter 
    with words
  till action might become them better
  
   
  to see sad sights moves more than hear them told
  
  for then the eye interprets to the ear 
  the heavy motion that it doth behold
  
  when every part a part of woe doth bear
  
   tis but a part of sorrow that we hear
  
    deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords
  
    and sorrow ebbs
  being blown with wind of words
  
   
  her letter now is seal d
  and on it writ 
   at ardea to my lord with more than haste
   
  the post attends
  and she delivers it
  
  charging the sour fac d groom to hie as fast 
  as lagging fowls before the northern blast
  
    speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems
  
    extremely still urgeth such extremes
  
   
  the homely villain court sies to her low
  
  and
  blushing on her
  with a steadfast eye 
  receives the scroll
  without or yea or no
  
  and forth with bashful innocence doth hie
  
  but they whose guilt within their bosoms lie 
    imagine every eye beholds their blame
  
    for lucrece thought he blush d to see her shame
  
   
  when
  silly groom
  god wot
  it was defect 
  of spirit
  life
  and bold audacity
  
  such harmless creatures have a true respect 
  to talk in deeds
  while others saucily 
  promise more speed
  but do it leisurely
  
    even so this pattern of the worn out age 
    pawn d honest looks
  but laid no words to gage
  
   
  his kindled duty kindled her mistrust
  
  that two red fires in both their faces blaz d
  
  she thought he blush d
  as knowing tarquin s lust
  
  and
  blushing with him
  wistly on him gaz d
  
  her earnest eye did make him more amaz d
  
    the more saw the blood his cheeks replenish
  
    the more she thought he spied in her some blemish
  
   
  but long she thinks till he return again
  
  and yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone
  
  the weary time she cannot entertain
  
  for now  tis stale to sigh
  to weep
  to groan
  
  so woe hath wearied woe
  moan tired moan
  
    that she her plaints a little while doth stay
  
    pausing for means to mourn some newer way
  
   
  at last she calls to mind where hangs a piece 
  of skilful painting
  made for priam s troy
  
  before the which is drawn the power of greece
  
  for helen s rape the city to destroy
  
  threat ning cloud kissing ilion with annoy
  
    which the conceited painter drew so proud
  
    as heaven  it seem d  to kiss the turrets bow d
  
   
  a thousand lamentable objects there
  
  in scorn of nature
  art gave lifeless life
  
  many a dry drop seem d a weeping tear
  
  shed for the slaughter d husband by the wife
  
  the red blood reek d
  to show the painter s strife
  
    the dying eyes gleam d forth their ashy lights
  
    like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights
  
   
  there might you see the labouring pioner 
  begrim d with sweat
  and smeared all with dust
  
  and from the towers of troy there would appear 
  the very eyes of men through loopholes thrust
  
  gazing upon the greeks with little lust
  
    such sweet observance in this work was had
  
    that one might see those far off eyes look sad
  
   
  in great commanders grace and majesty 
  you might behold
  triumphing in their faces
  
  in youth
  quick bearing and dexterity
  
  and here and there the painter interlaces 
  pale cowards
  marching on with trembling paces
  
    which heartless peasants did so well resemble
  
    that one would swear he saw them quake and tremble
  
   
  in ajax and ulysses
  o
  what art 
  of physiognomy might one behold
  
  the face of either  cipher d either s heart
  
  their face their manners most expressly told
  
  in ajax  eyes blunt rage and rigour roll d
  
    but the mild glance that sly ulysses lent 
    show d deep regard and smiling government
  
   
  there pleading might you see grave nestor stand
  
  as t were encouraging the greeks to fight
  
  making such sober action with his hand 
  that it beguiled attention
  charm d the sight
  
  in speech
  it seem d
  his beard
  all silver white
  
    wagg d up and down
  and from his lips did fly 
    thin winding breath
  which purl d up to the sky
  
   
  about him were a press of gaping faces
  
  which seem d to swallow up his sound advice
  
  all jointly listening
  but with several graces
  
  as if some mermaid did their ears entice
  
  some high
  some low
  the painter was so nice
  
    the scalps of many
  almost hid behind
  
    to jump up higher seem d to mock the mind
  
   
  here one man s hand lean d on another s head
  
  his nose being shadow d by his neighbour s ear
  
  here one being throng d bears back
  all boll n and red
  
  another smother d seems to pelt and swear
  
  and in their rage such signs of rage they bear
  
    as
  but for loss of nestor s golden words
  
    it seem d they would debate with angry swords
  
   
  for much imaginary work was there
  
  conceit deceitful
  so compact
  so kind
  
  that for achilles  image stood his spear
  
  grip d in an armed hand
  himself
  behind
  
  was left unseen
  save to the eye of mind
  
    a hand
  a foot
  a face
  a leg
  a head
  
    stood for the whole to be imagined
  
   
  and from the walls of strong besieged troy 
  when their brave hope
  bold hector
  march d to field
  
  stood many trojan mothers
  sharing joy 
  to see their youthful sons bright weapons wield
  
  and to their hope they such odd action yield
  
    that through their light joy seemed to appear
  
     like bright things stain d  a kind of heavy fear
  
   
  and
  from the strond of dardan
  where they fought
  
  to simois  reedy banks
  the red blood ran
  
  whose waves to imitate the battle sought 
  with swelling ridges
  and their ranks began 
  to break upon the galled shore
  and than 
    retire again
  till
  meeting greater ranks
  
    they join
  and shoot their foam at simois  banks
  
   
  to this well painted piece is lucrece come
  
  to find a face where all distress is stell d
  
  many she sees where cares have carved some
  
  but none where all distress and dolour dwell d
  
  till she despairing hecuba beheld
  
    staring on priam s wounds with her old eyes
  
    which bleeding under pyrrhus  proud foot lies
  
   
  in her the painter had anatomiz d 
  time s ruin
  beauty s wrack
  and grim care s reign
  
  her cheeks with chops and wrinkles were disguis d
  
  of what she was no semblance did remain
  
  her blue blood
  chang d to black in every vein
  
    wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed
  
    show d life imprison d in a body dead
  
   
  on this sad shadow lucrece spends her eyes
  
  and shapes her sorrow to the beldame s woes
  
  who nothing wants to answer her but cries
  
  and bitter words to ban her cruel foes
  
  the painter was no god to lend her those
  
    and therefore lucrece swears he did her wrong
  
    to give her so much grief
  and not a tongue
  
   
   poor instrument
   quoth she
   without a sound
  
  i ll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue
  
  and drop sweet balm in priam s painted wound
  
  and rail on pyrrhus that hath done him wrong
  
  and with my tears quench troy that burns so long
  
    and with my knife scratch out the angry eyes 
    of all the greeks that are thine enemies
  
   
   show me the strumpet that began this stir
  
  that with my nails her beauty i may tear
  
  thy heat of lust
  fond paris
  did incur 
  this load of wrath that burning troy doth bear
  
  thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here
  
    and here in troy
  for trespass of thine eye
  
    the sire
  the son
  the dame
  and daughter die
  
   
   why should the private pleasure of some one 
  become the public plague of many mo
  
  let sin
  alone committed
  light alone 
  upon his head that hath transgressed so
  
  let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe
  
    for one s offence why should so many fall
  
    to plague a private sin in general
  
   
   lo
  here weeps hecuba
  here priam dies
  
  here manly hector faints
  here troilus swounds
  
  here friend by friend in bloody channel lies
  
  and friend to friend gives unadvised wounds
  
  and one man s lust these many lives confounds
  
    had doting priam check d his son s desire
  
    troy had been bright with fame and not with fire
   
   
  here feelingly she weeps troy s painted woes
  
  for sorrow
  like a heavy hanging bell
  
  once set on ringing
  with his own weight goes
  
  then little strength rings out the doleful knell
  
  so lucrece set a work sad tales doth tell 
    to pencill d pensiveness and colour d sorrow
  
    she lends them words
  and she their looks doth borrow
  
   
  she throws her eyes about the painting round
  
  and whom she finds forlorn she doth lament
  
  at last she sees a wretched image bound
  
  that piteous looks to phrygian shepherds lent
  
  his face
  though full of cares
  yet show d content
  
    onward to troy with the blunt swains he goes
  
    so mild
  that patience seem d to scorn his woes
  
   
  in him the painter labour d with his skill 
  to hide deceit
  and give the harmless show 
  an humble gait
  calm looks
  eyes wailing still
  
  a brow unbent
  that seem d to welcome woe
  
  cheeks neither red nor pale
  but mingled so 
    that blushing red no guilty instance gave
  
    nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have
  
   
  but
  like a constant and confirmed devil
  
  he entertain d a show so seeming just
  
  and therein so ensconc d his secret evil
  
  that jealousy itself cold not mistrust 
  false creeping craft and perjury should thrust 
    into so bright a day such black fac d storms
  
    or blot with hell born sin such saint like forms
  
   
  the well skill d workman this mild image drew 
  for perjur d sinon
  whose enchanting story 
  the credulous old priam after slew
  
  whose words
  like wildfire
  burnt the shining glory 
  of rich built ilion
  that the skies were sorry
  
    and little stars shot from their fixed places
  
    when their glass fell wherein they view d their faces
  
   
  this picture she advisedly perus d
  
  and chid the painter for his wondrous skill
  
  saying
  some shape in sinon s was abus d
  
  so fair a form lodged not a mind so ill
  
  and still on him she gaz d
  and gazing still
  
    such signs of truth in his plain face she spied
  
    that she concludes the picture was belied
  
   
   it cannot be
   quoth she
   that so much guile    
   she would have said   can lurk in such a look
   
  but tarquin s shape came in her mind the while
  
  and from her tongue  can lurk  from  cannot  took
  
   it cannot be  she in that sense forsook
  
    and turn d it thus
   it cannot be
  i find
  
    but such a face should bear a wicked mind
  
   
   for even as subtle sinon here is painted
  
  so sober sad
  so weary
  and so mild
  
   as if with grief or travail he had fainted
   
  to me came tarquin armed
  so beguil d 
  with outward honesty
  but yet defil d 
    with inward vice
  as priam him did cherish
  
    so did i tarquin
  so my troy did perish
  
   
   look
  look
  how listening priam wets his eyes
  
  to see those borrow d tears that sinon sheds
  
  priam
  why art thou old and yet not wise
  
  for every tear he falls a trojan bleeds
  
  his eye drops fire
  no water thence proceeds
  
    those round clear pearls of his that move thy pity
  
    are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city
  
   
   such devils steal effects from lightless hell
  
  for sinon in his fire doth quake with cold
  
  and in that cold hot burning fire doth dwell
  
  these contraries such unity do hold
  
  only to flatter fools
  and make them bold
  
    so priam s trust false sinon s tears doth flatter
  
    that he finds means to burn his troy with water
   
   
  here
  all enrag d
  such passion her assails
  
  that patience is quite beaten from her breast
  
  she tears the senseless sinon with her nails
  
  comparing him to that unhappy guest 
  whose deed hath made herself herself detest
  
    at last she smilingly with this gives o er
  
     fool
  fool
   quoth she
   his wounds will not be sore
   
   
  thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow
  
  and time doth weary time with her complaining
  
  she looks for night
  and then she longs for morrow
  
  and both she thinks too long with her remaining
  
  short time seems long in sorrow s sharp sustaining
  
    though woe be heavy
  yet it seldom sleeps
  
    and they that watch see time how slow it creeps
  
   
  which all this time hath overslipp d her thought
  
  that she with painted images hath spent
  
  being from the feeling of her own grief brought 
  by deep surmise of others  detriment
  
  losing her woes in shows of discontent
  
    it easeth some
  though none it ever cur d
  
    to think their dolour others have endur d
  
   
  but now the mindful messenger
  come back
  
  brings home his lord and other company
  
  who finds his lucrece clad in mourning black
  
  and round about her tear distained eye 
  blue circles stream d
  like rainbows in the sky
  
    these water galls in her dim element 
    foretell new storms to those already spent
  
   
  which when her sad beholding husband saw
  
  amazedly in her sad face he stares
  
  her eyes
  though sod in tears
  look d red and raw
  
  her lively colour kill d with deadly cares
  
  he hath no power to ask her how she fares
  
    both stood
  like old acquaintance in a trance
  
    met far from home
  wondering each other s chance
  
   
  at last he takes her by the bloodless hand
  
  and thus begins
   what uncouth ill event 
  hath thee befall n
  that thou dost trembling stand
  
  sweet love
  what spite hath thy fair colour spent
  
  why art thou thus attir d in discontent
  
    unmask
  dear dear
  this moody heaviness
  
    and tell thy grief
  that we may give redress
   
   
  three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire
  
  ere once she can discharge one word of woe
  
  at length address d to answer his desire
  
  she modestly prepares to let them know 
  her honour is ta en prisoner by the foe
  
    while collatine and his consorted lords 
    with sad attention long to hear her words
  
   
  and now this pale swan in her watery nest 
  begins the sad dirge of her certain ending
  
   few words
   quoth she
   shall fit the trespass best
  
  where no excuse can give the fault amending
  
  in me more woes than words are now depending
  
    and my laments would be drawn out too long
  
    to tell them all with one poor tired tongue
  
   
   then be this all the task it hath to say
    
  dear husband
  in the interest of thy bed 
  a stranger came
  and on that pillow lay 
  where thou wast wont to rest thy weary head
  
  and what wrong else may be imagined 
    by foul enforcement might be done to me
  
    from that
  alas
  thy lucrece is not free
  
   
   for in the dreadful dead of dark midnight
  
  with shining falchion in my chamber came 
  a creeping creature
  with a flaming light
  
  and softly cried awake
  thou roman dame
  
  and entertain my love
  else lasting shame 
    on thee and thine this night i will inflict
  
    if thou my love s desire do contradict
  
   
   for some hard favour d groom of thine
  quoth he
  
  unless thou yoke thy liking to my will
  
  i ll murder straight
  and then i ll slaughter thee 
  and swear i found you where you did fulfil 
  the loathsome act of lust
  and so did kill 
    the lechers in their deed
  this act will be 
    my fame and thy perpetual infamy
  
   
   with this
  i did begin to start and cry
  
  and then against my heart he sets his sword
  
  swearing
  unless i took all patiently
  
  i should not live to speak another word
  
  so should my shame still rest upon record
  
    and never be forgot in mighty rome 
    the adulterate death of lucrece and her groom
  
   
   mine enemy was strong
  my poor self weak
  
  and far the weaker with so strong a fear
  
  my bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak
  
  no rightful plea might plead for justice there
  
  his scarlet lust came evidence to swear 
    that my poor beauty had purloin d his eyes
  
    and when the judge is robb d the prisoner dies
  
   
   o
  teach me how to make mine own excuse
  
  or at the least this refuge let me find
  
  though my gross blood be stain d with this abuse
  
  immaculate and spotless is my mind
  
  that was not forc d
  that never was inclin d 
    to accessary yieldings
  but still pure 
    doth in her poison d closet yet endure
   
   
  lo
  here
  the hopeless merchant of this loss
  
  with head declin d
  and voice damm d up with woe
  
  with sad set eyes
  and wretched arms across
  
  from lips new waxen pale begins to blow 
  the grief away that stops his answer so
  
    but wretched as he is he strives in vain
  
    what he breathes out his breath drinks up again
  
   
  as through an arch the violent roaring tide 
  outruns the eye that doth behold his haste
  
  yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride 
  back to the strait that forc d him on so fast
  
  in rage sent out
  recall d in rage
  being past
  
    even so his sighs
  his sorrows make a saw
  
    to push grief on
  and back the same grief draw
  
   
  which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth
  
  and his untimely frenzy thus awaketh
  
   dear lord
  thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth 
  another power
  no flood by raining slaketh
  
  my woe too sensible thy passion maketh 
    more feeling painful
  let it then suffice 
    to drown one woe
  one pair of weeping eyes
  
   
   and for my sake
  when i might charm thee so
  
  for she that was thy lucrece
   now attend me
  
  be suddenly revenged on my foe
  
  thine
  mine
  his own
  suppose thou dost defend me 
  from what is past
  the help that thou shalt lend me 
    comes all too late
  yet let the traitor die
  
    for sparing justice feeds iniquity
  
   
   but ere i name him
  you fair lords
   quoth she
  
   speaking to those that came with collatine  
   shall plight your honourable faiths to me
  
  with swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine
  
  for  tis a meritorious fair design 
    to chase injustice with revengeful arms
  
    knights
  by their oaths
  should right poor ladies  harms
   
   
  at this request
  with noble disposition 
  each present lord began to promise aid
  
  as bound in knighthood to her imposition
  
  longing to hear the hateful foe bewray d
  
  but she
  that yet her sad task hath not said
  
    the protestation stops
   o
  speak
   quoth she
  
    how may this forced stain be wip d from me
  
   
   what is the quality of mine offence
  
  being constrain d with dreadful circumstance
  
  may my pure mind with the foul act dispense
  
  my low declined honour to advance
  
  may any terms acquit me from this chance
  
    the poison d fountain clears itself again
  
    and why not i from this compelled stain
  
   
  with this
  they all at once began to say
  
  her body s stain her mind untainted clears
  
  while with a joyless smile she turns away 
  the face
  that map which deep impression bears 
  of hard misfortune
  carv d in it with tears
  
     no
  no
   quoth she
   no dame
  hereafter living
  
    by my excuse shall claim excuse s giving
  
   
  here with a sigh
  as if her heart would break
  
  she throws forth tarquin s name
   he
  he
   she says
  
  but more than  he  her poor tongue could not speak
  
  till after many accents and delays
  
  untimely breathings
  sick and short assays
  
    she utters this
   he
  he
  fair lords
   tis he
  
    that guides this hand to give this wound to me
   
   
  even here she sheathed in her harmless breast 
  a harmful knife
  that thence her soul unsheath d
  
  that blow did bail it from the deep unrest 
  of that polluted prison where it breath d
  
  her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath d 
    her winged sprite
  and through her wounds doth fly 
    life s lasting date from cancell d destiny
  
   
  stone still
  astonish d with this deadly deed
  
  stood collatine and all his lordly crew
  
  till lucrece  father that beholds her bleed
  
  himself on her self slaughter d body threw
  
  and from the purple fountain brutus drew 
    the murderous knife
  and
  as it left the place
  
    her blood
  in poor revenge
  held it in chase
  
   
  and bubbling from her breast
  it doth divide 
  in two slow rivers
  that the crimson blood 
  circles her body in on every side
  
  who
  like a late sack d island
  vastly stood 
  bare and unpeopled
  in this fearful flood
  
    some of her blood still pure and red remain d
  
    and some look d black
  and that false tarquin stain d
  
   
  about the mourning and congealed face 
  of that black blood a watery rigol goes
  
  which seems to weep upon the tainted place
  
  and ever since
  as pitying lucrece  woes
  
  corrupted blood some watery token shows
  
    and blood untainted still doth red abide
  
    blushing at that which is so putrified
  
   
   daughter
  dear daughter
   old lucretius cries
  
   that life was mine which thou hast here depriv d
  
  if in the child the father s image lies
  
  where shall i live now lucrece is unliv d
  
  thou wast not to this end from me deriv d 
    if children pre decease progenitors
  
    we are their offspring
  and they none of ours
  
   
   poor broken glass
  i often did behold 
  in thy sweet semblance my old age new born
  
  but now that fair fresh mirror
  dim and old
  
  shows me a bare bon d death by time outworn
  
  o
  from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn
  
    and shiver d all the beauty of my glass
  
    that i no more can see what once i was
  
   
   o time
  cease thou thy course and last no longer
  
  if they surcease to be that should survive
  
  shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
  
  and leave the faltering feeble souls alive
  
  the old bees die
  the young possess their hive
  
    then live
  sweet lucrece
  live again
  and see 
    thy father die
  and not thy father thee
   
   
  by this starts collatine as from a dream
  
  and bids lucretius give his sorrow place
  
  and then in key cold lucrece  bleeding stream 
  he falls
  and bathes the pale fear in his face
  
  and counterfeits to die with her a space
  
    till manly shame bids him possess his breath
  
    and live
  to be revenged on her death
  
   
  the deep vexation of his inward soul 
  hath serv d a dumb arrest upon his tongue
  
  who
  mad that sorrow should his use control
  
  or keep him from heart easing words so long
  
  begins to talk
  but through his lips do throng 
    weak words
  so thick come in his poor heart s aid
  
    that no man could distinguish what he said
  
   
  yet sometime  tarquin  was pronounced plain
  
  but through his teeth
  as if the name he tore
  
  this windy tempest
  till it blow up rain
  
  held back his sorrow s tide
  to make it more
  
  at last it rains
  and busy winds give o er
  
    then son and father weep with equal strife
  
    who should weep most
  for daughter or for wife
  
   
  the one doth call her his
  the other his
  
  yet neither may possess the claim they lay
  
  the father says  she s mine
    o
  mine she is
   
  replies her husband
   do not take away 
  my sorrow s interest
  let no mourner say 
    he weeps for her
  for she was only mine
  
    and only must be wail d by collatine
   
   
   o
   quoth lucretius
   i did give that life 
  which she too early and too late hath spill d
   
   woe
  woe
   quoth collatine
   she was my wife
  
  i owed her
  and  tis mine that she hath kill d
   
   my daughter  and  my wife  with clamours fill d 
    the dispers d air
  who
  holding lucrece  life
  
    answer d their cries
   my daughter
   and  my wife
   
   
  brutus
  who pluck d the knife from lucrece  side
  
  seeing such emulation in their woe
  
  began to clothe his wit in state and pride
  
  burying in lucrece  wound his folly s show
  
  he with the romans was esteemed so 
    as silly jeering idiots are with kings
  
    for sportive words
  and uttering foolish things
  
   
  but now he throws that shallow habit by
  
  wherein deep policy did him disguise
  
  and arm d his long hid wits advisedly
  
  to check the tears in collatinus  eyes
  
   thou wronged lord of rome
   quoth he
   arise
  
    let my unsounded self
  suppos d a fool
  
    now set thy long experienc d wit to school
  
   
   why
  collatine
  is woe the cure for woe
  
  do wounds help wounds
  or grief help grievous deeds
  
  is it revenge to give thyself a blow
  
  for his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds
  
  such childish humour from weak minds proceeds
  
    thy wretched wife mistook the matter so
  
    to slay herself
  that should have slain her foe

  do not steep thy heart 
  in such relenting dew of lamentations
  
  but kneel with me
  and help to bear thy part
  
  to rouse our roman gods with invocations
  
  that they will suffer these abominations
  
    since rome herself in them doth stand disgrac d
   
    by our strong arms from forth her fair streets chas d
  
   
   now
  by the capitol that we adore
  
  and by this chaste blood so unjustly stain d
  
  by heaven s fair sun that breeds the fat earth s store
  
  by all our country rights in rome maintain d
  
  and by chaste lucrece  soul that late complain d 
    her wrongs to us
  and by this bloody knife
  
    we will revenge the death of this true wife
   
   
  this said
  he struck his hand upon his breast
  
  and kiss d the fatal knife
  to end his vow
  
  and to his protestation urg d the rest
  
  who
  wondering at him
  did his words allow
  
  then jointly to the ground their knees they bow
  
    and that deep vow
  which brutus made before
  
    he doth again repeat
  and that they swore
  
   
  when they had sworn to this advised doom
  
  they did conclude to bear dead lucrece thence
  
  to show her bleeding body thorough rome
  
  and so to publish tarquin s foul offence
  
  which being done with speedy diligence
  
    the romans plausibly did give consent 
    to tarquin s everlasting banishment
