  slight occasion that could but nigardly giue mee 
  sight of her
  not only bought many presents to giue her

  hath pursued mee
  which hath beene on the wing of all 
  occasions
  but whatsoeuer i haue merited
  either in my 
  minde
  or in my meanes
  meede i am sure i haue receiued 
  none
  vnlesse experience be a iewell
  that i haue purchased 
  at an infinite rate

    pursuing that that flies
  and flying what pursues

  now
  could i come to her with any detection 
  in my hand
  my desires had instance and argument to 
  commend themselues
  i could driue her then from the 
  ward of her purity

  she hath consented
  now sir
  
  her mother
   euen strong against that match 
  and firme for doctor caius  hath appointed 
  that he shall likewise shuffle her away
  
  while other sports are tasking of their mindes

  where a priest attends 
  strait marry her
  to this her mothers plot 
  she seemingly obedient  likewise hath 
  made promise to the doctor
  now
  thus it rests
  
  her father meanes she shall be all in white
  
  and in that habit
  when slender sees his time 
  to take her by the hand
  and bid her goe
  
  she shall goe with him
  her mother hath intended 
   the better to deuote her to the doctor
  
  for they must all be mask d
  and vizarded  
  that quaint in greene
  she shall be loose en roab d
  
  with ribonds pendant
  flaring  bout her head
  
  and when the doctor spies his vantage ripe
  
  to pinch her by the hand
  and on that token
  
  the maid hath giuen consent to go with him
