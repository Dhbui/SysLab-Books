  nat fer fro cantebrigge
  
   ther gooth a brook
  and over that a brigge
  
   upon the whiche brook ther stant a melle
  
   and this is verray sooth that i yow telle
  
   a millere was ther dwellynge many a day
  
   as any pecok he was proud and gay
  
   pipen he koude and fisshe
  and nettes beete
  
   and turne coppes
  and wel wrastle and sheete
  
   ay by his belt he baar a long panade
  
  3930 and of a swerd ful trenchant was the blade
  
   a joly poppere baar he in his pouche
  
   ther was no man
  for peril
  dorste hym touche
  
   a sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose
  
   round was his face
  and camus was his nose
  
   as piled as an ape was his skulle
  
   he was a market betere atte fulle
  
   ther dorste no wight hand upon hym legge
  
   that he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge
  
   a theef he was for sothe of corn and mele
  
  3940 and that a sly
  and usaunt for to stele
  
   his name was hoote deynous symkyn
  
   a wyf he hadde
  ycomen of noble kyn
  
   the person of the toun hir fader was
  
   with hire he yaf ful many a panne of bras
  
   for that symkyn sholde in his blood allye
  
   she was yfostred in a nonnerye
  
   for symkyn wolde no wyf
  as he sayde
  
   but she were wel ynorissed and a mayde
  
   to saven his estaat of yomanrye
  
  3950 and she was proud
  and peert as is a pye
  
   a ful fair sighte was it upon hem two
  
   on halydayes biforn hire wolde he go 
   with his typet wounde aboute his heed
  
   and she cam after in a gyte of reed
  
   and symkyn hadde hosen of the same
  
   ther dorste no wight clepen hire but 
 dame
 
  
   was noon so hardy that wente by the weye 
   that with hire dorste rage or ones pleye
  
   but if he wolde be slayn of symkyn 
  3960 with panade
  or with knyf
  or boidekyn
  
   for jalous folk ben perilous everemo    
   algate they wolde hire wyves wenden so
  
   and eek
  for she was somdel smoterlich
  
   she was as digne as water in a dich
  
   and ful of hoker and of bisemare
  
   hir thoughte that a lady sholde hire spare
  
   what for hire kynrede and hir nortelrie 
   that she hadde lerned in the nonnerie

   with buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye
  
   but right fair was hire heer

   this person of the toun
  for she was feir
  
   in purpos was to maken hire his heir
  
   bothe of his catel and his mesuage
  
  3980 and straunge he made it of hir mariage
  
   his purpos was for to bistowe hire hye 
   into som worthy blood of auncetrye
  
   for hooly chirches good moot been despended 
   on hooly chirches blood
  that is descended
  
   therfore he wolde his hooly blood honoure
  
   though that he hooly chirche sholde devoure
  
   greet sokene hath this millere
  out of doute
  
   with whete and malt of al the land aboute
  
   and nameliche ther was a greet collegge 
  3990 men clepen the soler halle at cantebregge

   sik lay the maunciple on a maladye
  
   men wenden wisly that he sholde dye
  
   for which this millere stal bothe mele and corn 
   an hundred tyme moore than biforn
  
   for therbiforn he stal but curteisly
  
   but now he was a theef outrageously
  
   for which the wardeyn chidde and made fare
  
  4000 but therof sette the millere nat a tare
  
   he craketh boost
  and swoor it was nat so
  
   thanne were ther yonge povre scolers two
