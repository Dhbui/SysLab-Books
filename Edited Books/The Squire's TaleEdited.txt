   for ye youreself upon yourself yow wreke
  
   which proveth wel that outher ire or drede 
   moot been enchesoun of youre cruel dede
  
   syn that i see noon oother wight yow chace
  
   for love of god
  as dooth youreselven grace
  
   or what may been youre help
  for west nor est 
  460 ne saugh i nevere er now no bryd ne beest 
   that ferde with hymself so pitously
  
   ye sle me with youre sorwe verraily
  
   i have of yow so greet compassioun
  
   for goddes love
  com fro the tree adoun
  
   and as i am a kynges doghter trewe
  
   if that i verraily the cause knewe 
   of youre disese
  if it lay in my myght
  
   i wolde amenden it er that it were nyght
  
   as wisly helpe me grete god of kynde
  
  470 and herbes shal i right ynowe yfynde 
   to heel with youre hurtes hastily
 
  
   tho shrighte this faucon yet moore pitously 
   than ever she dide
  and fil to grounde anon
  
   and lith aswowne
  deed and lyk a stoon
  
   til canacee hath in hire lappe hire take 
   unto the tyme she gan of swough awake
  
   and after that she of hir swough gan breyde
  
   right in hir haukes ledene thus she seyde
  
   
 that pitee renneth soone in gentil herte
  
  480 feelynge his similitude in peynes smerte
  
   is preved alday
  as men may it see
  
   as wel by werk as by auctoritee
  
   for gentil herte kitheth gentillesse
  
   i se wel that ye han of my distresse 
   compassion
  my faire canacee
  
   of verray wommanly benignytee 
   that nature in youre principles hath set
  
   but for noon hope for to fare the bet
  
   but for to obeye unto youre herte free
  
  490 and for to maken othere be war by me
  
   as by the whelp chasted is the leon
  
   right for that cause and that conclusion
  
   whil that i have a leyser and a space
  
   myn harm i wol confessen er i pace
 
  
   and evere
  whil that oon hir sorwe tolde
  
   that oother weep as she to water wolde 
   til that the faucon bad hire to be stille
  
   and
  with a syk
  right thus she seyde hir wille
  
   
 ther i was bred    allas
  that ilke day
     
  500 and fostred in a roche of marbul gray 
   so tendrely that no thyng eyled me
  
   i nyste nat what was adversitee 
   til i koude flee ful hye under the sky
  
   tho dwelte a tercelet me faste by
  
   that semed welle of alle gentillesse
  
   al were he ful of treson and falsnesse
  
   it was so wrapped under humble cheere
  
   and under hewe of trouthe in swich manere
  
   under plesance
  and under bisy peyne
  
  510 that no wight koude han wend he koude feyne
  
   so depe in greyn he dyed his coloures
  
   right as a serpent hit hym under floures 
   til he may seen his tyme for to byte
  
   right so this god of loves ypocryte 
   dooth so his cerymonyes and obeisaunces
  
   and kepeth in semblaunt alle his observaunces 
   that sownen into gentillesse of love
  
   as in a toumbe is al the faire above
  
   and under is the corps
  swich as ye woot
  
  520 swich was this ypocrite
  bothe coold and hoot
  
   and in this wise he served his entente 
   that
  save the feend
  noon wiste what he mente
  
   til he so longe hadde wopen and compleyned
  
   and many a yeer his service to me feyned
  
   til that myn herte
  to pitous and to nyce
  
   al innocent of his crouned malice
  
   forfered of his deeth
  as thoughte me
  
   upon his othes and his seuretee
  
   graunted hym love
  upon this condicioun
  
  530 that everemoore myn honour and renoun 
   were saved
  bothe privee and apert
  
   this is to seyn
  that after his desert
  
   i yaf hym al myn herte and al my thoght    
   god woot and he
  that ootherwise noght    
   and took his herte in chaunge of myn for ay
  
   but sooth is seyd
  goon sithen many a day
  
    a trewe wight and a theef thenken nat oon
   
   and whan he saugh the thyng so fer ygoon 
   that i hadde graunted hym fully my love 
  540 in swich a gyse as i have seyd above
  
   and yeven hym my trewe herte as free 
   as he swoor he yaf his herte to me
  
   anon this tigre
  ful of doublenesse
  
   fil on his knees with so devout humblesse
  
   with so heigh reverence
  and
  as by his cheere
  
   so lyk a gentil lovere of manere
  
   so ravysshed
  as it semed
  for the joye 
   that nevere jason ne parys of troye    
   jason
  certes
  ne noon oother man 
  550 syn lameth was
  that alderfirst bigan 
   to loven two
  as writen folk biforn    
   ne nevere
  syn the firste man was born
  
   ne koude man
  by twenty thousand part
  
   countrefete the sophymes of his art
  
   ne were worthy unbokelen his galoche
  
   ther doublenesse or feynyng sholde approche
  
   ne so koude thonke a wight as he dide me
  
   his manere was an hevene for to see 
   til any womman
  were she never so wys
  
  560 so peynted he and kembde at point devys 
   as wel his wordes as his contenaunce
  
   and i so loved hym for his obeisaunce
  
   and for the trouthe i demed in his herte
  
   that if so were that any thyng hym smerte
  
   al were it never so lite
  and i it wiste
  
   me thoughte i felte deeth myn herte twiste
  
   and shortly
  so ferforth this thyng is went 
   that my wyl was his willes instrument
  
   this is to seyn
  my wyl obeyed his wyl 
  570 in alle thyng
  as fer as reson fil
  
   kepynge the boundes of my worshipe evere
  
   ne nevere hadde i thyng so lief
  ne levere
  
   as hym
  god woot
  ne nevere shal namo
  
   
 this laste lenger than a yeer or two
  
   that i supposed of hym noght but good
  
   but finally
  thus atte laste it stood
  
   that fortune wolde that he moste twynne 
   out of that place which that i was inne
  
   wher me was wo
  that is no questioun
  
  580 i kan nat make of it discripsioun
  
   for o thyng dar i tellen boldely
  
   i knowe what is the peyne of deeth therby
  
   swich harm i felte for he ne myghte bileve
  
   so on a day of me he took his leve
  
   so sorwefully eek that i wende verraily 
   that he had felt as muche harm as i
  
   whan that i herde hym speke and saugh his hewe
  
   but nathelees
  i thoughte he was so trewe
  
   and eek that he repaire sholde ageyn 
  590 withinne a litel while
  sooth to seyn
  
   and resoun wolde eek that he moste go 
   for his honour
  as ofte it happeth so
  
   that i made vertu of necessitee
  
   and took it wel
  syn that it moste be
  
   as i best myghte
  i hidde fro hym my sorwe
  
   and took hym by the hond
  seint john to borwe
  
   and seyde hym thus
   lo
  i am youres al
  
   beth swich as i to yow have been and shal
   
   what he answerde
  it nedeth noght reherce
  
  600 who kan sey bet than he
  who kan do werse
  
   whan he hath al wel seyd
  thanne hath he doon
  
    therfore bihoveth hire a ful long spoon 
   that shal ete with a feend
   thus herde i seye
  
   so atte laste he moste forth his weye
  
   and forth he fleeth til he cam ther hym leste
  
   whan it cam hym to purpos for to reste
  
   i trowe he hadde thilke text in mynde
  
   that  alle thyng
  repeirynge to his kynde
  
   gladeth hymself
   thus seyn men
  as i gesse
  
  610 men loven of propre kynde newefangelnesse
  
   as briddes doon that men in cages fede
  
   for though thou nyght and day take of hem hede
  
   and strawe hir cage faire and softe as silk
  
   and yeve hem sugre
  hony
  breed and milk
  
   yet right anon as that his dore is uppe 
   he with his feet wol spurne adoun his cuppe
  
   and to the wode he wole and wormes ete
  
   so newefangel been they of hire mete
  
   and loven novelries of propre kynde
  
  620 no gentillesse of blood ne may hem bynde
  
   
 so ferde this tercelet
  allas the day
  
   though he were gentil born
  and fressh and gay
  
   and goodlich for to seen
  and humble and free
  
   he saugh upon a tyme a kyte flee
  
   and sodeynly he loved this kyte so 
   that al his love is clene fro me ago
  
   and hath his trouthe falsed in this wyse
  
   thus hath the kyte my love in hire servyse
  
   and i am lorn withouten remedie
 
  
  630 and with that word this faucon gan to crie 
   and swowned eft in canacees barm
  
   greet was the sorwe for the haukes harm 
   that canacee and alle hir wommen made
  
   they nyste hou they myghte the faucon glade
  
   but canacee hom bereth hire in hir lappe
  
   and softely in plastres gan hire wrappe
  
   ther as she with hire beek hadde hurt hirselve
  
   now kan nat canacee but herbes delve 
   out of the ground
  and make salves newe 
  640 of herbes preciouse and fyne of hewe 
   to heelen with this hauk
  fro day to nyght 
   she dooth hire bisynesse and al hire myght
  
   and by hire beddes heed she made a mewe 
   and covered it with veluettes blewe
  
   in signe of trouthe that is in wommen sene
  
   and al withoute
  the mewe is peynted grene
  
   in which were peynted alle thise false fowles
  
   as ben thise tidyves
  tercelettes
  and owles
  
   right for despit were peynted hem bisyde
  
  650 pyes

   thus lete i canacee hir hauk kepyng
  
   i wol namoore as now speke of hir ryng 
   til it come eft to purpos for to seyn 
   how that this faucon gat hire love ageyn
