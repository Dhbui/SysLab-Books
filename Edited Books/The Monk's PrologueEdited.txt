   i hadde levere than a barel ale 
   that goodelief

   for she nys no thyng of swich pacience 
   as was this melibeus wyf prudence
  
   by goddes bones
  whan i bete my knaves
  
   she bryngeth me forth the grete clobbed staves
  
   and crieth
   slee the dogges everichoon

 and if that any neighebor of myne 
   wol nat in chirche to my wyf enclyne
  
   or be so hardy to hire to trespace
  
   whan she comth hoom she rampeth in my face
  
   and crieth

   and thou shalt have my distaf and go spynne
   
   fro day to nyght right thus she wol bigynne

  1910 to wedden a milksop
  or a coward ape
  
   that wol been overlad with every wight
  
   thou darst nat stonden by thy wyves right
   
   
 this is my lif
  but if that i wol fighte
  
   and out at dore anon i moot me dighte
