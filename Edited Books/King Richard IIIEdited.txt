  duke of gloucester
  solus 
   
    gloucester
  now is the winter of our discontent 
      made glorious summer by this sun of york
  
      and all the clouds that lour d upon our house 
      in the deep bosom of the ocean buried
  
      now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths
  
      our bruised arms hung up for monuments
  
      our stern alarums chang d to merry meetings
  
      our dreadful marches to delightful measures
  
      grim visag d war hath smooth d his wrinkled front
  
      and now
  instead of mounting barbed steeds 
      to fright the souls of fearful adversaries
  
      he capers nimbly in a lady s chamber 
      to the lascivious pleasing of a lute
  
      but i that am not shap d for sportive tricks
  
      nor made to court an amorous looking glass  
      i that am rudely stamp d
  and want love s majesty 
      to strut before a wanton ambling nymph  
      i that am curtail d of this fair proportion
  
      cheated of feature by dissembling nature
  
      deform d
  unfinish d
  sent before my time 
      into this breathing world scarce half made up
  
      and that so lamely and unfashionable 
      that dogs bark at me as i halt by them  
      why
  i
  in this weak piping time of peace
  
      have no delight to pass away the time
  
      unless to spy my shadow in the sun 
      and descant on mine own deformity
  
      and therefore
  since i cannot prove a lover 
      to entertain these fair well spoken days
  
      i am determined to prove a villain 
      and hate the idle pleasures of these days
  
      plots have i laid
  inductions dangerous
  
      by drunken prophecies
  libels
  and dreams
  
      to set my brother clarence and the king 
      in deadly hate the one against the other
  
      and if king edward be as true and just 
      as i am subtle
  false
  and treacherous
  
      this day should clarence closely be mew d up  
      about a prophecy which says that g 
      of edward s heirs the murderer shall be
  
      dive
  thoughts
  down to my soul
  here clarence comes
  
   
               enter clarence
  guarded
  and brakenbury 
   
      brother
  good day
  what means this armed guard 
      that waits upon your grace
  
    clarence
  his majesty
  
      tend ring my person s safety
  hath appointed 
      this conduct to convey me to th  tower
  
    gloucester
  upon what cause
  
    clarence
  because my name is george
  
    gloucester
  alack
  my lord
  that fault is none of yours
  
      he should
  for that
  commit your godfathers
  
      o
  belike his majesty hath some intent 
      that you should be new christ ned in the tower
  
      but what s the matter
  clarence
  may i know
  
    clarence
  yea
  richard
  when i know
  for i protest 
      as yet i do not
  but
  as i can learn
  
      he hearkens after prophecies and dreams
  
      and from the cross row plucks the letter g
  
      and says a wizard told him that by g 
      his issue disinherited should be
  
      and
  for my name of george begins with g
  
      it follows in his thought that i am he
  
      these
  as i learn
  and such like toys as these 
      hath mov d his highness to commit me now
  
    gloucester
  why
  this it is when men are rul d by women
  
       tis not the king that sends you to the tower
  
      my lady grey his wife
  clarence
   tis she 
      that tempers him to this extremity
  
      was it not she and that good man of worship
  
      antony woodville
  her brother there
  
      that made him send lord hastings to the tower
  
      from whence this present day he is delivered
  
      we are not safe
  clarence
  we are not safe
  
    clarence
  by heaven
  i think there is no man is secure 
      but the queen s kindred
  and night walking heralds 
      that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore
  
      heard you not what an humble suppliant 
      lord hastings was
  for her delivery
  
    gloucester
  humbly complaining to her deity 
      got my lord chamberlain his liberty
  
      i ll tell you what i think it is our way
  
      if we will keep in favour with the king
  
      to be her men and wear her livery
  
      the jealous o er worn widow
  and herself
  
      since that our brother dubb d them gentlewomen
  
      are mighty gossips in our monarchy
  
    brakenbury
  i beseech your graces both to pardon me
  
      his majesty hath straitly given in charge 
      that no man shall have private conference
  
      of what degree soever
  with your brother
  
    gloucester
  even so
  an t please your worship
  brakenbury
  
      you may partake of any thing we say
  
      we speak no treason
  man
  we say the king 
      is wise and virtuous
  and his noble queen 
      well struck in years
  fair
  and not jealous
  
      we say that shore s wife hath a pretty foot
  
      a cherry lip
  a bonny eye
  a passing pleasing tongue
  
      and that the queen s kindred are made gentlefolks
  
      how say you
  sir
  can you deny all this
  
    brakenbury
  with this
  my lord
  myself have naught to do
  
    gloucester
  naught to do with mistress shore
  i tell thee
  
      fellow
  
      he that doth naught with her
  excepting one
  
      were best to do it secretly alone
  
    brakenbury
  what one
  my lord
  
    gloucester
  her husband
  knave
  wouldst thou betray me
  
    brakenbury
  i do beseech your grace to pardon me
  and 
      withal 
      forbear your conference with the noble duke
  
    clarence
  we know thy charge
  brakenbury
  and will 
      obey
  
    gloucester
  we are the queen s abjects and must obey
  
      brother
  farewell
  i will unto the king
  
      and whatsoe er you will employ me in  
      were it to call king edward s widow sister  
      i will perform it to enfranchise you
  
      meantime
  this deep disgrace in brotherhood 
      touches me deeper than you can imagine
  
    clarence
  i know it pleaseth neither of us well
  
    gloucester
  well
  your imprisonment shall not be long
  
      i will deliver or else lie for you
  
      meantime
  have patience
  
    clarence
  i must perforce
  farewell
  
                            exeunt clarence
  brakenbury
  and guard 
    gloucester
  go tread the path that thou shalt ne er return
  
      simple
  plain clarence
  i do love thee so 
      that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven
  
      if heaven will take the present at our hands
  
      but who comes here
  the new delivered hastings
  
   
                         enter lord hastings 
   
    hastings
  good time of day unto my gracious lord
  
    gloucester
  as much unto my good lord chamberlain
  
      well are you welcome to the open air
  
      how hath your lordship brook d imprisonment
  
    hastings
  with patience
  noble lord
  as prisoners must
  
      but i shall live
  my lord
  to give them thanks 
      that were the cause of my imprisonment
  
    gloucester
  no doubt
  no doubt
  and so shall clarence too
  
      for they that were your enemies are his
  
      and have prevail d as much on him as you
  
    hastings
  more pity that the eagles should be mew d 
      whiles kites and buzzards prey at liberty
  
    gloucester
  what news abroad
  
    hastings
  no news so bad abroad as this at home
  
      the king is sickly
  weak
  and melancholy
  
      and his physicians fear him mightily
  
    gloucester
  now
  by saint john
  that news is bad indeed
  
      o
  he hath kept an evil diet long 
      and overmuch consum d his royal person
  
       tis very grievous to be thought upon
  
      where is he
  in his bed
  
    hastings
  he is
  
    gloucester
  go you before
  and i will follow you
  
                                                     exit hastings 
      he cannot live
  i hope
  and must not die 
      till george be pack d with posthorse up to heaven
  
      i ll in to urge his hatred more to clarence 
      with lies well steel d with weighty arguments
  
      and
  if i fail not in my deep intent
  
      clarence hath not another day to live
  
      which done
  god take king edward to his mercy
  
      and leave the world for me to bustle in
  
      for then i ll marry warwick s youngest daughter
  
      what though i kill d her husband and her father
  
      the readiest way to make the wench amends 
      is to become her husband and her father
  
      the which will i not all so much for love 
      as for another secret close intent 
      by marrying her which i must reach unto
  
      but yet i run before my horse to market
  
      clarence still breathes
  edward still lives and reigns
  
      when they are gone
  then must i count my gains
          exit

      pale ashes of the house of lancaster

      lo
  in these windows that let forth thy life

      cursed the blood that let this blood from hence
  
      more direful hap betide that hated wretch 
      that makes us wretched by the death of thee

  sweet saint
  for charity

    anne
  foul devil

      for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell 
      fill d it with cursing cries and deep exclaims
  
      if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds
  
      behold this pattern of thy butcheries
  
      o
  gentlemen

  dead henry s wounds

  thou lump of foul deformity
  
      for  tis thy presence that exhales this blood 
      from cold and empty veins where no blood dwells
  
      thy deeds inhuman and unnatural

      o god

      as thou dost swallow up this good king s blood
  
      which his hell govern d arm hath butchered
  
    gloucester
  lady
  you know no rules of charity
  
      which renders good for bad
  blessings for curses
  
    anne
  villain
  thou knowest nor law of god nor man
  
      no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity
  
    gloucester
  but i know none
  and therefore am no beast
  
    anne
  o wonderful
  when devils tell the truth
  
    gloucester
  more wonderful when angels are so angry
  
      vouchsafe
  divine perfection of a woman
  
      of these supposed crimes to give me leave 
      by circumstance but to acquit myself
  
    anne
  vouchsafe
  diffus d infection of a man
  
      of these known evils but to give me leave 
      by circumstance to accuse thy cursed self
  
    gloucester
  fairer than tongue can name thee
  let me have 
      some patient leisure to excuse myself
  
    anne
  fouler than heart can think thee
  thou canst make 
      no excuse current but to hang thyself
  
    gloucester
  by such despair i should accuse myself
  
    anne
  and by despairing shalt thou stand excused 
      for doing worthy vengeance on thyself 
      that didst unworthy slaughter upon others
  
    gloucester
  say that i slew them not
  
    anne
  then say they were not slain
  
      but dead they are
  and
  devilish slave
  by thee
  
    gloucester
  i did not kill your husband
  
    anne
  why
  then he is alive
  
    gloucester
  nay
  he is dead
  and slain by edward s hands
  
    anne
  in thy foul throat thou liest
  queen margaret saw 
      thy murd rous falchion smoking in his blood
  
      the which thou once didst bend against her breast
  
      but that thy brothers beat aside the point
  
    gloucester
  i was provoked by her sland rous tongue 
      that laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders
  
    anne
  thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind
  
      that never dream st on aught but butcheries
  
      didst thou not kill this king
  
    gloucester
  i grant ye
  
    anne
  dost grant me
  hedgehog
  then
  god grant me to 
      thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed
  
      o
  he was gentle
  mild
  and virtuous
  
    gloucester
  the better for the king of heaven
  that hath 
      him
  
    anne
  he is in heaven
  where thou shalt never come
  
    gloucester
  let him thank me that holp to send him 
      thither
  
      for he was fitter for that place than earth
  
    anne
  and thou unfit for any place but hell
  
    gloucester
  yes
  one place else
  if you will hear me name it
  
    anne
  some dungeon
  
    gloucester
  your bed chamber
  
    anne
  ill rest betide the chamber where thou liest
  
    gloucester
  so will it
  madam
  till i lie with you
  
    anne
  i hope so
  
    gloucester
  i know so
  but
  gentle lady anne
  
      to leave this keen encounter of our wits
  
      and fall something into a slower method  
      is not the causer of the timeless deaths 
      of these plantagenets
  henry and edward
  
      as blameful as the executioner
  
    anne
  thou wast the cause and most accurs d effect
  
    gloucester
  your beauty was the cause of that effect  
      your beauty that did haunt me in my sleep 
      to undertake the death of all the world 
      so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom
  
    anne
  if i thought that
  i tell thee
  homicide
  
      these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks
  
    gloucester
  these eyes could not endure that beauty s 
      wreck
  
      you should not blemish it if i stood by
  
      as all the world is cheered by the sun
  
      so i by that
  it is my day
  my life
  
    anne
  black night o ershade thy day
  and death thy life
  
    gloucester
  curse not thyself
  fair creature
  thou art both
  
    anne
  i would i were
  to be reveng d on thee
  
    gloucester
  it is a quarrel most unnatural
  
      to be reveng d on him that loveth thee
  
    anne
  it is a quarrel just and reasonable
  
      to be reveng d on him that kill d my husband
  
    gloucester
  he that bereft thee
  lady
  of thy husband 
      did it to help thee to a better husband
  
    anne
  his better doth not breathe upon the earth
  
    gloucester
  he lives that loves thee better than he could
  
    anne
  name him
  
    gloucester
  plantagenet
  
    anne
  why
  that was he
  
    gloucester
  the self same name
  but one of better nature
  
    anne
  where is he
  
    gloucester
  here
    she spits at him   why dost thou spit 
      at me
  
    anne
  would it were mortal poison
  for thy sake
  
    gloucester
  never came poison from so sweet a place
  
    anne
  never hung poison on a fouler toad
  
      out of my sight
  thou dost infect mine eyes
  
    gloucester
  thine eyes
  sweet lady
  have infected mine
  
    anne
  would they were basilisks to strike thee dead
  
    gloucester
  i would they were
  that i might die at once
  
      for now they kill me with a living death
  
      those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears
  
      sham d their aspects with store of childish drops  
      these eyes
  which never shed remorseful tear
  
      no
  when my father york and edward wept 
      to hear the piteous moan that rutland made 
      when black fac d clifford shook his sword at him
  
      nor when thy warlike father
  like a child
  
      told the sad story of my father s death
  
      and twenty times made pause to sob and weep 
      that all the standers by had wet their cheeks 
      like trees bedash d with rain in that sad time 
      my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear
  
      and what these sorrows could not thence exhale 
      thy beauty hath
  and made them blind with weeping
  
      i never sued to friend nor enemy
  
      my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word
  
      but
  now thy beauty is propos d my fee
  
      my proud heart sues
  and prompts my tongue to speak
  
                                      she looks scornfully at him  
      teach not thy lip such scorn
  for it was made 
      for kissing
  lady
  not for such contempt
  
      if thy revengeful heart cannot forgive
  
      lo here i lend thee this sharp pointed sword
  
      which if thou please to hide in this true breast 
      and let the soul forth that adoreth thee
  
      i lay it naked to the deadly stroke
  
      and humbly beg the death upon my knee
  
         he lays his breast open
  she offers at it with his sword  
      nay
  do not pause
  for i did kill king henry  
      but  twas thy beauty that provoked me
  
      nay
  now dispatch
   twas i that stabb d young edward  
      but  twas thy heavenly face that set me on
  
                                              she falls the sword  
      take up the sword again
  or take up me
  
    anne
  arise
  dissembler
  though i wish thy death
  
      i will not be thy executioner
  
    gloucester
  then bid me kill myself
  and i will do it
  
    anne
  i have already
  
    gloucester
  that was in thy rage
  
      speak it again
  and even with the word 
      this hand
  which for thy love did kill thy love
  
      shall for thy love kill a far truer love
  
      to both their deaths shalt thou be accessary
  
    anne
  i would i knew thy heart
  
    gloucester
   tis figur d in my tongue
  
    anne
  i fear me both are false
  
    gloucester
  then never was man true
  
    anne
  well put up your sword
  
    gloucester
  say
  then
  my peace is made
  
    anne
  that shalt thou know hereafter
  
    gloucester
  but shall i live in hope
  
    anne
  all men
  i hope
  live so
  
    gloucester
  vouchsafe to wear this ring
  
    anne
  to take is not to give
                 puts on the ring  
    gloucester
  look how my ring encompasseth thy finger
  
      even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart
  
      wear both of them
  for both of them are thine
  
      and if thy poor devoted servant may 
      but beg one favour at thy gracious hand
  
      thou dost confirm his happiness for ever
  
    anne
  what is it
  
    gloucester
  that it may please you leave these sad designs 
      to him that hath most cause to be a mourner
  
      and presently repair to crosby house
  
      where after i have solemnly interr d 
      at chertsey monast ry this noble king
  
      and wet his grave with my repentant tears  
      i will with all expedient duty see you
  
      for divers unknown reasons
  i beseech you
  
      grant me this boon
  
    anne
  with all my heart
  and much it joys me too 
      to see you are become so penitent
  
      tressel and berkeley
  go along with me
  
    gloucester
  bid me farewell
  
    anne
   tis more than you deserve
  
      but since you teach me how to flatter you
  
      imagine i have said farewell already

      i ll have her
  but i will not keep her long
  
      what
  i that kill d her husband and his father  
      to take her in her heart s extremest hate
  
      with curses in her mouth

      the bleeding witness of my hatred by
  
      having god
  her conscience
  and these bars against me

      edward

  some three months since

      a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman

      young
  valiant
  wise

      the spacious world cannot again afford
  
      and will she yet abase her eyes on me
  
      that cropp d the golden prime of this sweet prince 
      and made her widow to a woeful bed
  
      on me
  whose all not equals edward s moiety
  
      on me

      my dukedom to a beggarly denier
  
      i do mistake my person all this while

  although i cannot
  
      myself to be a marv llous proper man
  
      i ll be at charges for a looking glass
  
      and entertain a score or two of tailors 
      to study fashions to adorn my body
  
      since i am crept in favour with myself
  
      i will maintain it with some little cost
  
      but first i ll turn yon fellow in his grave
  
      and then return lamenting to my love
  
      shine out
  fair sun
  till i have bought a glass
  
      that i may see my shadow as i pass

    rivers
  have patience
  madam
  there s no doubt his majesty 
      will soon recover his accustom d health
  
    grey
  in that you brook it ill
  it makes him worse
  
      therefore
  for god s sake
  entertain good comfort
  
      and cheer his grace with quick and merry eyes
  
    queen elizabeth
  if he were dead
  what would betide on 
      me
  
    grey
  no other harm but loss of such a lord
  
    queen elizabeth
  the loss of such a lord includes all 
      harms
  
    grey
  the heavens have bless d you with a goodly son 
      to be your comforter when he is gone
  
    queen elizabeth
  ah
  he is young
  and his minority 
      is put unto the trust of richard gloucester
  
      a man that loves not me
  nor none of you
  
    river
  is it concluded he shall be protector
  
    queen elizabeth
  it is determin d
  not concluded yet
  
      but so it must be
  if the king miscarry
  
   
                       enter buckingham and derby 
   
    grey
  here come the lords of buckingham and derby
  
    buckingham
  good time of day unto your royal grace
  
    derby
  god make your majesty joyful as you have been
  
    queen elizabeth
  the countess richmond
  good my lord 
      of derby
  
      to your good prayer will scarcely say amen
  
      yet
  derby
  notwithstanding she s your wife 
      and loves not me
  be you
  good lord
  assur d 
      i hate not you for her proud arrogance
  
    derby
  i do beseech you
  either not believe 
      the envious slanders of her false accusers
  
      or
  if she be accus d on true report
  
      bear with her weakness
  which i think proceeds 
      from wayward sickness and no grounded malice
  
    queen elizabeth
  saw you the king to day
  my lord of 
      derby
  
    derby
  but now the duke of buckingham and i 
      are come from visiting his majesty
  
    queen elizabeth
  what likelihood of his amendment
  
      lords
  
    buckingham
  madam
  good hope
  his grace speaks 
      cheerfully
  
    queen elizabeth
  god grant him health
  did you confer 
      with him
  
    buckingham
  ay
  madam
  he desires to make atonement 
      between the duke of gloucester and your brothers
  
      and between them and my lord chamberlain
  
      and sent to warn them to his royal presence
  
    queen elizabeth
  would all were well
  but that will 
      never be
  
      i fear our happiness is at the height
  
   
                enter gloucester
  hastings
  and dorset 
   
    gloucester
  they do me wrong
  and i will not endure it
  
      who is it that complains unto the king 
      that i
  forsooth
  am stern and love them not
  
      by holy paul
  they love his grace but lightly 
      that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours
  
      because i cannot flatter and look fair
  
      smile in men s faces
  smooth
  deceive
  and cog
  
      duck with french nods and apish courtesy
  
      i must be held a rancorous enemy
  
      cannot a plain man live and think no harm 
      but thus his simple truth must be abus d 
      with silken
  sly
  insinuating jacks
  
    grey
  to who in all this presence speaks your grace
  
    gloucester
  to thee
  that hast nor honesty nor grace
  
      when have i injur d thee
  when done thee wrong
  
      or thee
  or thee
  or any of your faction
  
      a plague upon you all
  his royal grace  
      whom god preserve better than you would wish
   
      cannot be quiet searce a breathing while 
      but you must trouble him with lewd complaints
  
    queen elizabeth
  brother of gloucester
  you mistake the 
      matter
  
      the king
  on his own royal disposition 
      and not provok d by any suitor else  
      aiming
  belike
  at your interior hatred 
      that in your outward action shows itself 
      against my children
  brothers
  and myself  
      makes him to send that he may learn the ground
  
    gloucester
  i cannot tell
  the world is grown so bad 
      that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch
  
      since every jack became a gentleman
  
      there s many a gentle person made a jack
  
    queen elizabeth
  come
  come
  we know your meaning
  
      brother gloucester
  
      you envy my advancement and my friends 
  
      god grant we never may have need of you
  
    gloucester
  meantime
  god grants that i have need of you
  
      our brother is imprison d by your means
  
      myself disgrac d
  and the nobility 
      held in contempt
  while great promotions 
      are daily given to ennoble those 
      that scarce some two days since were worth a noble
  
    queen elizabeth
  by him that rais d me to this careful 
      height 
      from that contented hap which i enjoy d
  
      i never did incense his majesty 
      against the duke of clarence
  but have been 
      an earnest advocate to plead for him
  
      my lord
  you do me shameful injury 
      falsely to draw me in these vile suspects

  why
  who knows 
      not so
  
      she may do more
  sir
  than denying that
  
      she may help you to many fair preferments 
      and then deny her aiding hand therein
  
      and lay those honours on your high desert

  my lord of gloucester
  i have too long 
      borne 
      your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs
  
      by heaven
  i will acquaint his majesty 
      of those gross taunts that oft i have endur d
  
      i had rather be a country servant maid 
      than a great queen with this condition  
      to be so baited
  scorn d

      and edward
  my poor son
  at tewksbury
  
    gloucester
  ere you were queen
  ay
  or your husband 
      king
  
      i was a pack horse in his great affairs
  
      a weeder out of his proud adversaries
  
      a liberal rewarder of his friends
  
      to royalize his blood i spent mine own
  
    queen margaret
  ay
  and much better blood than his or 
      thine
  
    gloucester
  in all which time you and your husband grey 
      were factious for the house of lancaster
  
      and
  rivers
  so were you
  was not your husband 
      in margaret s battle at saint albans slain
  
      let me put in your minds
  if you forget
  
      what you have been ere this
  and what you are
  
      withal
  what i have been
  and what i am
  
    queen margaret
  a murd rous villain
  and so still thou art
  
    gloucester
  poor clarence did forsake his father
  warwick
  
      ay
  and forswore himself which jesu pardon
   
    queen margaret
  which god revenge
  
    gloucester
  to fight on edward s party for the crown
  
      and for his meed
  poor lord
  he is mewed up
  
      i would to god my heart were flint like edward s
  
      or edward s soft and pitiful like mine
  
      i am too childish foolish for this world
  
    queen margaret
  hie thee to hell for shame and leave this 
      world
  
      thou cacodemon

    rivers
  my lord of gloucester

      which here you urge to prove us enemies
  
      we follow d then our lord
  our sovereign king
  
      so should we you
  if you should be our king
  
    gloucester
  if i should be
  i had rather be a pedlar
  
      far be it from my heart
  the thought thereof
  
    queen elizabeth
  as little joy
  my lord
  as you suppose 
      you should enjoy were you this country s king
  
      as little joy you may suppose in me 
      that i enjoy
  being the queen thereof
  
    queen margaret
  as little joy enjoys the queen thereof
  
      for i am she
  and altogether joyless
  
      i can no longer hold me patient
                   advancing  
      hear me
  you wrangling pirates
  that fall out 
      in sharing that which you have pill d from me
  
      which of you trembles not that looks on me

  foul wrinkled witch
  what mak st thou in my 
      sight
  
    queen margaret
  but repetition of what thou hast marr d
  
      that will i make before i let thee go
  
    gloucester
  wert thou not banished on pain of death
  
    queen margaret
  i was
  but i do find more pain in 
      banishment 
      than death can yield me here by my abode
  
      a husband and a son thou ow st to me
  
      and thou a kingdom
  all of you allegiance
  
      this sorrow that i have by right is yours
  
      and all the pleasures you usurp are mine
  
    gloucester
  the curse my noble father laid on thee
  
      when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper 
      and with thy scorns drew st rivers from his eyes
  
      and then to dry them gav st the duke a clout 
      steep d in the faultless blood of pretty rutland  
      his curses then from bitterness of soul 
      denounc d against thee are all fall n upon thee
  
      and god
  not we
  hath plagu d thy bloody deed
  
    queen elizabeth
  so just is god to right the innocent
  
    hastings
  o
   twas the foulest deed to slay that babe
  
      and the most merciless that e er was heard of
  
    rivers
  tyrants themselves wept when it was reported
  
    dorset
  no man but prophesied revenge for it
  
    buckingham
  northumberland
  then present
  wept to see it
  
    queen margaret
  what
  were you snarling all before i came
  
      ready to catch each other by the throat
  
      and turn you all your hatred now on me
  
      did york s dread curse prevail so much with heaven 
      that henry s death
  my lovely edward s death
  
      their kingdom s loss
  my woeful banishment
  
      should all but answer for that peevish brat
  
      can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven
  
      why then
  give way
  dull clouds
  to my quick curses
  
      though not by war
  by surfeit die your king
  
      as ours by murder
  to make him a king

  for me that was a queen
  
      outlive thy glory
  like my wretched self
  
      long mayest thou live to wail thy children s death
  
      and see another
  as i see thee now
  
      deck d in thy rights
  as thou art stall d in mine
  
      long die thy happy days before thy death
  
      and
  after many length ned hours of grief
  
      die neither mother
  wife
  nor england s queen
  
      rivers and dorset
  you were standers by
  
      and so wast thou
  lord hastings
  when my son 
      was stabb d with bloody daggers
  god
  i pray him
  
      that none of you may live his natural age
  
      but by some unlook d accident cut off
  
    gloucester
  have done thy charm
  thou hateful wither d 
      hag
  
    queen margaret
  and leave out thee
  stay

  for thou 
      shalt hear me
  
      if heaven have any grievous plague in store 
      exceeding those that i can wish upon thee
  
      o
  let them keep it till thy sins be ripe
  
      and then hurl down their indignation 
      on thee
  the troubler of the poor world s peace
  
      the worm of conscience still be gnaw thy soul
  
      thy friends suspect for traitors while thou liv st

      the day will come that thou shalt wish for me 
      to help thee curse this poisonous bunch back d toad

  you have all 
      mov d mine
  
    rivers
  were you well serv d
  you would be taught your 
        duty
  
    queen margaret
  to serve me well you all should do me 
      duty
  
      teach me to be your queen and you my subjects

    queen margaret
  peace
  master marquis
  you are malapert
  
      your fire new stamp of honour is scarce current
  
      o
  that your young nobility could judge 
      what  twere to lose it and be miserable
  
      they that stand high have many blasts to shake them
  
      and if they fall they dash themselves to pieces
  
    gloucester
  good counsel
  marry
  learn it
  learn it
  marquis
  
    dorset
  it touches you
  my lord
  as much as me
  
    gloucester
  ay
  and much more
  but i was born so high
  
      our aery buildeth in the cedar s top
  
      and dallies with the wind
  and scorns the sun
  
    queen margaret
  and turns the sun to shade alas
  alas
  
      witness my son
  now in the shade of death
  
      whose bright out shining beams thy cloudy wrath 
      hath in eternal darkness folded up
  
      your aery buildeth in our aery s nest
  
      o god that seest it
  do not suffer it
  
      as it is won with blood
  lost be it so
  
    buckingham

  peace
  for shame
  if not for charity
  
    queen margaret
  urge neither charity nor shame to me
  
      uncharitably with me have you dealt
  
      and shamefully my hopes by you are butcher d
  
      my charity is outrage
  life my shame
  
      and in that shame still live my sorrow s rage
  
    buckingham
  have done
  have done
  
    queen margaret
  o princely buckingham
  i ll kiss thy 
      hand 
      in sign of league and amity with thee
  
      now fair befall thee and thy noble house
  
      thy garments are not spotted with our blood
  
      nor thou within the compass of my curse
  
    buckingham
  nor no one here
  for curses never pass 
      the lips of those that breathe them in the air
  
    queen margaret
  i will not think but they ascend the sky 
      and there awake god s gentle sleeping peace
  
      o buckingham
  take heed of yonder dog
  
      look when he fawns
  he bites
  and when he bites
  
      his venom tooth will rankle to the death
  
      have not to do with him
  beware of him
  
      sin
  death
  and hell
  have set their marks on him
  
      and all their ministers attend on him
  
    gloucester
  what doth she say
  my lord of buckingham
  
    buckingham
  nothing that i respect
  my gracious lord
  
    queen margaret
  what
  dost thou scorn me for my gentle 
      counsel
  
      and soothe the devil that i warn thee from
  
      o
  but remember this another day
  
      when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow
  
      and say poor margaret was a prophetess
  
      live each of you the subjects to his hate
  
      and he to yours
  and all of you to god s
                exit 
    buckingham
  my hair doth stand an end to hear her curses
  
    rivers
  and so doth mine
  i muse why she s at liberty
  
    gloucester
  i cannot blame her
  by god s holy mother
  
      she hath had too much wrong
  and i repent 
      my part thereof that i have done to her
  
    queen elizabeth
  i never did her any to my knowledge
  
    gloucester
  yet you have all the vantage of her wrong
  
      i was too hot to do somebody good 
      that is too cold in thinking of it now
  
      marry
  as for clarence
  he is well repaid
  
      he is frank d up to fatting for his pains
  
      god pardon them that are the cause thereof
  
    rivers
  a virtuous and a christian like conclusion
  
      to pray for them that have done scathe to us

    gloucester
  i do the wrong
  and first begin to brawl
  
      the secret mischiefs that i set abroach 
      i lay unto the grievous charge of others
  
      clarence
  who i indeed have cast in darkness
  
      i do beweep to many simple gulls
  
      namely
  to derby
  hastings
  buckingham
  
      and tell them  tis the queen and her allies 
      that stir the king against the duke my brother
  
      now they believe it
  and withal whet me 
      to be reveng d on rivers
  dorset
  grey
  
      but then i sigh and
  with a piece of scripture
  
      tell them that god bids us do good for evil
  
      and thus i clothe my naked villainy 
      with odd old ends stol n forth of holy writ
  
      and seem a saint when most i play the devil
  
   
                         enter two murderers 
   
      but
  soft
  here come my executioners
  
      how now
  my hardy stout resolved mates
  
      are you now going to dispatch this thing
  
    first murderer
  we are
  my lord

      warrant
  
      that we may be admitted where he is

  well thought upon
  i have it here about me
  
                                                gives the warrant  
      when you have done
  repair to crosby place
  
      but
  sirs
  be sudden in the execution
  
      withal obdurate
  do not hear him plead
  
      for clarence is well spoken
  and perhaps 
      may move your hearts to pity
  if you mark him
  
    first murderer
  tut

  enter clarence and keeper 
   
    keeper
  why looks your grace so heavily to day
  
    clarence
  o
  i have pass d a miserable night
  
      so full of fearful dreams
  of ugly sights
  
      that
  as i am a christian faithful man
  
      i would not spend another such a night 
      though  twere to buy a world of happy days  
      so full of dismal terror was the time
  
    keeper
  what was your dream
  my lord
  i pray you 
      tell me
  
    clarence
  methoughts that i had broken from the tower 
      and was embark d to cross to burgundy
  
      and in my company my brother gloucester
  
      who from my cabin tempted me to walk 
      upon the hatches
  thence we look d toward england
  
      and cited up a thousand heavy times
  
      during the wars of york and lancaster
  
      that had befall n us
  as we pac d along 
      upon the giddy footing of the hatches
  
      methought that gloucester stumbled
  and in falling 
      struck me
  that thought to stay him
  overboard 
      into the tumbling billows of the main
  
      o lord
  methought what pain it was to drown
  
      what dreadful noise of waters in my ears
  
      what sights of ugly death within my eyes
  
      methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks
  
      a thousand men that fishes gnaw d upon
  
      wedges of gold
  great anchors
  heaps of pearl
  
      inestimable stones
  unvalued jewels
  
      all scatt red in the bottom of the sea
  
      some lay in dead men s skulls
  and in the holes 
      where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
  
      as  twere in scorn of eyes
  reflecting gems
  
      that woo d the slimy bottom of the deep 
      and mock d the dead bones that lay scatt red by
  
    keeper
  had you such leisure in the time of death 
      to gaze upon these secrets of the deep
  
    clarence
  methought i had
  and often did i strive 
      to yield the ghost
  but still the envious flood 
      stopp d in my soul and would not let it forth 
      to find the empty
  vast
  and wand ring air
  
      but smother d it within my panting bulk
  
      who almost burst to belch it in the sea
  
    keeper
  awak d you not in this sore agony
  
    clarence
  no
  no
  my dream was lengthen d after life
  
      o
  then began the tempest to my soul
  
      i pass d
  methought
  the melancholy flood 
      with that sour ferryman which poets write of
  
      unto the kingdom of perpetual night
  
      the first that there did greet my stranger soul 
      was my great father in law
  renowned warwick
  
      who spake aloud  what scourge for perjury 
      can this dark monarchy afford false clarence
   
      and so he vanish d
  then came wand ring by 
      a shadow like an angel
  with bright hair 
      dabbled in blood
  and he shriek d out aloud 
       clarence is come false
  fleeting
  perjur d clarence
  
      that stabb d me in the field by tewksbury
  
      seize on him
  furies
  take him unto torment
   
      with that
  methoughts
  a legion of foul fiends 
      environ d me
  and howled in mine ears 
      such hideous cries that
  with the very noise
  
      i trembling wak d
  and for a season after 
      could not believe but that i was in hell
  
      such terrible impression made my dream
  
    keeper
  no marvel
  lord
  though it affrighted you
  
      i am afraid
  methinks
  to hear you tell it
  
    clarence
  ah
  keeper
  keeper
  i have done these things 
      that now give evidence against my soul 
      for edward s sake
  and see how he requites me
  
      o god
  if my deep prayers cannot appease thee
  
      but thou wilt be aveng d on my misdeeds
  
      yet execute thy wrath in me alone
  
      o
  spare my guiltless wife and my poor children
  
      keeper
  i prithee sit by me awhile
  
      my soul is heavy
  and i fain would sleep
  
    keeper
  i will
  my lord
  god give your grace good rest
  
                                                  clarence sleeps  
   
                    enter brakenbury the lieutenant 
   
    brakenbury
  sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours
  
      makes the night morning and the noontide night
  
      princes have but their titles for their glories
  
      an outward honour for an inward toil
  
      and for unfelt imaginations 
      they often feel a world of restless cares
  
      so that between their tides and low name 
      there s nothing differs but the outward fame
  
   
                        enter the two murderers 
   
    first murderer
  ho
  who s here
  
    brakenbury
  what wouldst thou
  fellow
  and how cam st 
      thou hither
  
    first murderer
  i would speak with clarence
  and i came 
      hither on my legs
  
    brakenbury
  what
  so brief
  
    second murderer
   tis better
  sir
  than to be tedious
  let 
      him see our commission and talk no more
  
                                              brakenbury reads it  
    brakenbury
  i am
  in this
  commanded to deliver 
      the noble duke of clarence to your hands
  
      i will not reason what is meant hereby
  
      because i will be guiltless from the meaning
  
      there lies the duke asleep
  and there the keys
  
      i ll to the king and signify to him 
      that thus i have resign d to you my charge
  
    first murderer
  you may
  sir
   tis a point of wisdom
  fare 
      you well
                        exeunt brakenbury and keeper 
    second murderer
  what
  shall i stab him as he sleeps
  
    first murderer
  no
  he ll say  twas done cowardly
  when 
      he wakes
  
    second murderer
  why
  he shall never wake until the great 
      judgment day
  
    first murderer
  why
  then he ll say we stabb d him 
      sleeping
  
    second murderer
  the urging of that word judgment hath 
      bred a kind of remorse in me
  
    first murderer
  what
  art thou afraid
  
    second murderer
  not to kill him
  having a warrant
  but to 
      be damn d for killing him
  from the which no warrant can 
      defend me
  
    first murderer
  i thought thou hadst been resolute
  
    second murderer
  so i am
  to let him live
  
    first murderer
  i ll back to the duke of gloucester and 
      tell him so
  
    second murderer
  nay
  i prithee
  stay a little
  i hope this 
      passionate humour of mine will change
  it was wont to 
      hold me but while one tells twenty
  
    first murderer
  how dost thou feel thyself now
  
      second murderer
  faith
  some certain dregs of conscience 
      are yet within me
  
    first murderer
  remember our reward
  when the deed s 
      done
  
    second murderer
  zounds
  he dies
  i had forgot the reward
  
    first murderer
  where s thy conscience now
  
    second murderer
  o
  in the duke of gloucester s purse
  
    first murderer
  when he opens his purse to give us our 
      reward
  thy conscience flies out
  
    second murderer
   tis no matter
  let it go
  there s few or 
      none will entertain it
  
    first murderer
  what if it come to thee again
  
    second murderer
  i ll not meddle with it it makes a man 
      coward
  a man cannot steal
  but it accuseth him
  a man 
      cannot swear
  but it checks him
  a man cannot lie with his 
      neighbour s wife
  but it detects him
   tis a blushing shame  
      fac d spirit that mutinies in a man s bosom
  it fills a man 
      full of obstacles
  it made me once restore a purse of gold 
      that by chance i found
  it beggars any man that keeps it
  
      it is turn d out of towns and cities for a dangerous thing
  
      and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust 
      to himself and live without it
  
    first murderer
  zounds
   tis even now at my elbow
  
      persuading me not to kill the duke
  
    second murderer
  take the devil in thy mind and believe 
      him not
  he would insinuate with thee but to make the 
      sigh
  
    first murderer
  i am strong fram d
  he cannot prevail with 
      me
  
    second murderer
  spoke like a tall man that respects thy 
      reputation
  come
  shall we fall to work
  
    first murderer
  take him on the costard with the hilts of 
      thy sword
  and then chop him in the malmsey butt in the 
      next room
  
    second murderer
  o excellent device
  and make a sop of 
      him
  
    first murderer
  soft
  he wakes
  
    second murderer
  strike
  
    first murderer
  no
  we ll reason with him
  
    clarence
  where art thou
  keeper
  give me a cup of wine
  
    second murderer
  you shall have wine enough
  my lord
  
      anon
  
    clarence
  in god s name
  what art thou
  
    first murderer
  a man
  as you are
  
    clarence
  but not as i am
  royal
  
    second murderer
  nor you as we are
  loyal
  
    clarence
  thy voice is thunder
  but thy looks are humble
  
    first murderer
  my voice is now the king s
  my looks 
      mine own
  
    clarence
  how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak
  
      your eyes do menace me
  why look you pale
  
      who sent you hither
  wherefore do you come
  
    second murderer
  to
  to
  to  
    clarence
  to murder me
  
    both murderers
  ay
  ay
  
    clarence
  you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so
  
      and therefore cannot have the hearts to do it
  
      wherein
  my friends
  have i offended you
  
    first murderer
  offended us you have not
  but the king
  
    clarence
  i shall be reconcil d to him again
  
    second murderer
  never
  my lord
  therefore prepare to die
  
    clarence
  are you drawn forth among a world of men 
      to slay the innocent
  what is my offence
  
      where is the evidence that doth accuse me
  
      what lawful quest have given their verdict up 
      unto the frowning judge
  or who pronounc d 
      the bitter sentence of poor clarence  death
  
      before i be convict by course of law
  
      to threaten me with death is most unlawful
  
      i charge you
  as you hope to have redemption 
      by christ s dear blood shed for our grievous sins
  
      that you depart and lay no hands on me
  
      the deed you undertake is damnable
  
    first murderer
  what we will do
  we do upon command
  
    second murderer
  and he that hath commanded is our 
      king
  
    clarence
  erroneous vassals
  the great king of kings 
      hath in the tables of his law commanded 
      that thou shalt do no murder
  will you then 
      spurn at his edict and fulfil a man s
  
      take heed
  for he holds vengeance in his hand 
      to hurl upon their heads that break his law
  
    second murderer
  and that same vengeance doth he hurl 
      on thee 
      for false forswearing
  and for murder too
  
      thou didst receive the sacrament to fight 
      in quarrel of the house of lancaster
  
    first murderer
  and like a traitor to the name of god 
      didst break that vow
  and with thy treacherous blade 
      unripp dst the bowels of thy sov reign s son
  
    second murderer
  whom thou wast sworn to cherish and 
      defend
  
    first murderer
  how canst thou urge god s dreadful law 
      to us
  
      when thou hast broke it in such dear degree
  
    clarence
  alas
  for whose sake did i that ill deed
  
      for edward
  for my brother
  for his sake
  
      he sends you not to murder me for this
  
      for in that sin he is as deep as i
  
      if god will be avenged for the deed
  
      o
  know you yet he doth it publicly
  
      take not the quarrel from his pow rful arm
  
      he needs no indirect or lawless course 
      to cut off those that have offended him
  
    first murderer
  who made thee then a bloody minister 
      when gallant springing brave plantagenet
  
      that princely novice
  was struck dead by thee
  
    clarence
  my brother s love
  the devil
  and my rage
  
    first murderer
  thy brother s love
  our duty
  and thy 
      faults
  
      provoke us hither now to slaughter thee
  
    clarence
  if you do love my brother
  hate not me
  
      i am his brother
  and i love him well
  
      if you are hir d for meed
  go back again
  
      and i will send you to my brother gloucester
  
      who shall reward you better for my life 
      than edward will for tidings of my death
  
    second murderer
  you are deceiv d
  your brother gloucester 
      hates you
  
    clarence
  o
  no
  he loves me
  and he holds me dear
  
      go you to him from me
  
    first murderer
  ay
  so we will
  
    clarence
  tell him when that our princely father york 
      bless d his three sons with his victorious arm 
      and charg d us from his soul to love each other
  
      he little thought of this divided friendship
  
      bid gloucester think of this
  and he will weep
  
    first murderer
  ay
  millstones
  as he lesson d us to weep
  
    clarence
  o
  do not slander him
  for he is kind
  
    first murderer
  right
  as snow in harvest
  come
  you 
      deceive yourself
  
       tis he that sends us to destroy you here
  
      clarence
  it cannot be
  for he bewept my fortune 
      and hugg d me in his arms
  and swore with sobs

    to the queen   whenever buckingham 
      doth turn his hate 
      upon your grace

      doth cherish you and yours
  god punish me 
      with hate in those where i expect most love
  
      when i have most need to employ a friend 
      and most assured that he is a friend
  
      deep
  hollow
  treacherous
  and full of guile
  
      be he unto me
  this do i beg of god 
      when i am cold in love to you or yours

  princely peers
  a happy time of day
  
    king edward
  happy
  indeed
  as we have spent the day
  
      gloucester
  we have done deeds of charity
  
      made peace of enmity
  fair love of hate
  
      between these swelling wrong incensed peers
  
    gloucester
  a blessed labour
  my most sovereign lord
  
      among this princely heap
  if any here
  
      by false intelligence or wrong surmise
  
      hold me a foe  
      if i unwittingly
  or in my rage
  
      have aught committed that is hardly borne 
      to any in this presence
  i desire 
      to reconcile me to his friendly peace
  
       tis death to me to be at enmity
  
      i hate it
  and desire all good men s love
  
      first
  madam
  i entreat true peace of you
  
      which i will purchase with my duteous service
  
      of you
  my noble cousin buckingham
  
      if ever any grudge were lodg d between us
  
      of you
  and you
  lord rivers
  and of dorset
  
      that all without desert have frown d on me
  
      of you
  lord woodville
  and
  lord scales
  of you
  
      dukes
  earls
  lords
  gentlemen indeed
  of all
  
      i do not know that englishman alive 
      with whom my soul is any jot at odds 
      more than the infant that is born to night
  
      i thank my god for my humility
  
    queen elizabeth
  a holy day shall this be kept hereafter
  
      i would to god all strifes were well compounded
  
      my sovereign lord
  i do beseech your highness 
      to take our brother clarence to your grace
  
    gloucester
  why
  madam
  have i off red love for this
  
      to be so flouted in this royal presence
  
      who knows not that the gentle duke is dead
  
                                                   they all start  
      you do him injury to scorn his corse
  
    king edward
  who knows not he is dead
  who knows 
      he is
  
    queen elizabeth
  all seeing heaven
  what a world is this
  
    buckingham
  look i so pale
  lord dorset
  as the rest
  
    dorset
  ay
  my good lord
  and no man in the presence 
      but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks
  
    king edward
  is clarence dead
  the order was revers d
  
    gloucester
  but he
  poor man
  by your first order died
  
      and that a winged mercury did bear
  
      some tardy cripple bare the countermand 
      that came too lag to see him buried
  
      god grant that some
  less noble and less loyal
  
      nearer in bloody thoughts
  an not in blood
  
      deserve not worse than wretched clarence did
  
      and yet go current from suspicion
  
   
                             enter derby 
   
    derby
  a boon
  my sovereign
  for my service done
  
    king edward
  i prithee
  peace
  my soul is full of sorrow
  
    derby
  i will not rise unless your highness hear me
  
    king edward
  then say at once what is it thou requests
  
    derby
  the forfeit
  sovereign
  of my servant s life
  
      who slew to day a riotous gentleman 
      lately attendant on the duke of norfolk
  
    king edward
  have i a tongue to doom my brother s death
  
      and shall that tongue give pardon to a slave
  
      my brother killed no man his fault was thought
  
      and yet his punishment was bitter death
  
      who sued to me for him
  who
  in my wrath
  
      kneel d at my feet
  and bid me be advis d
  
      who spoke of brotherhood
  who spoke of love
  
      who told me how the poor soul did forsake 
      the mighty warwick and did fight for me
  
      who told me
  in the field at tewksbury 
      when oxford had me down
  he rescued me 
      and said  dear brother
  live
  and be a king 
  
      who told me
  when we both lay in the field 
      frozen almost to death
  how he did lap me 
      even in his garments
  and did give himself
  
      all thin and naked
  to the numb cold night
  
      all this from my remembrance brutish wrath 
      sinfully pluck d
  and not a man of you 
      had so much race to put it in my mind
  
      but when your carters or your waiting vassals 
      have done a drunken slaughter and defac d 
      the precious image of our dear redeemer
  
      you straight are on your knees for pardon
  pardon
  
      and i
  unjustly too
  must grant it you
          derby rises  
      but for my brother not a man would speak
  
      nor i
  ungracious
  speak unto myself 
      for him
  poor soul
  the proudest of you all 
      have been beholding to him in his life
  
      yet none of you would once beg for his life
  
      o god
  i fear thy justice will take hold 
      on me
  and you
  and mine
  and yours
  for this
  
      come
  hastings
  help me to my closet
  ah
  poor clarence
  
                                   exeunt some with king and queen 
    gloucester
  this is the fruits of rashness
  mark d you not 
      how that the guilty kindred of the queen 
      look d pale when they did hear of clarence  death
  
      o
  they did urge it still unto the king
  
      god will revenge it
  come
  lords
  will you go 
      to comfort edward with our company
  
    buckingham
  we wait upon your grace

  clarence 
   
    son
  good grandam

    duchess

  boy
  
    daughter
  why do you weep so oft
  and beat your breast
  
      and cry  o clarence
  my unhappy son
  
  
    son
  why do you look on us
  and shake your head
  
      and call us orphans
  wretches
  castaways
  
      if that our noble father were alive
  
    duchess
  my pretty cousins
  you mistake me both
  
      i do lament the sickness of the king
  
      as loath to lose him
  not your father s death
  
      it were lost sorrow to wail one that s lost
  
    son
  then you conclude
  my grandam
  he is dead
  
      the king mine uncle is to blame for it
  
      god will revenge it
  whom i will importune 
      with earnest prayers all to that effect
  
    daughter
  and so will i
  
    duchess
  peace
  children
  peace
  the king doth love you 
      well
  
      incapable and shallow innocents
  
      you cannot guess who caus d your father s death
  
    son
  grandam
  we can
  for my good uncle gloucester 
      told me the king
  provok d to it by the queen
  
      devis d impeachments to imprison him
  
      and when my uncle told me so
  he wept
  
      and pitied me
  and kindly kiss d my cheek
  
      bade me rely on him as on my father
  
      and he would love me dearly as a child
  
    duchess
  ah
  that deceit should steal such gentle shape
  
      and with a virtuous vizor hide deep vice
  
      he is my son
  ay
  and therein my shame
  
      yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit
  
    son
  think you my uncle did dissemble
  grandam
  
    duchess
  ay
  boy
  
    son
  i cannot think it
  hark
  what noise is this
  
   
              enter queen elizabeth
  with her hair about her 
                  ears
  rivers and dorset after her 
   
    queen elizabeth
  ah
  who shall hinder me to wail and 
      weep
  
      to chide my fortune
  and torment myself
  
      i ll join with black despair against my soul 
      and to myself become an enemy
  
    duchess
  what means this scene of rude impatience
  
    queen elizabeth
  to make an act of tragic violence
  
    edward
  my lord
  thy son
  our king
  is dead
  
      why grow the branches when the root is gone
  
      why wither not the leaves that want their sap
  
      if you will live
  lament
  if die
  be brief
  
      that our swift winged souls may catch the king s
  
      or like obedient subjects follow him 
      to his new kingdom of ne er changing night
  
    duchess
  ah
  so much interest have i in thy sorrow 
      as i had title in thy noble husband
  
      i have bewept a worthy husband s death
  
      and liv d with looking on his images
  
      but now two mirrors of his princely semblance 
      are crack d in pieces by malignant death
  
      and i for comfort have but one false glass
  
      that grieves me when i see my shame in him
  
      thou art a widow
  yet thou art a mother 
      and hast the comfort of thy children left
  
      but death hath snatch d my husband from mine arms 
      and pluck d two crutches from my feeble hands  
      clarence and edward
  o
  what cause have i  
      thine being but a moiety of my moan  
      to overgo thy woes and drown thy cries
  
    son
  ah
  aunt
  you wept not for our father s death
  
      how can we aid you with our kindred tears
  
    daughter
  our fatherless distress was left unmoan d
  
      your widow dolour likewise be unwept
  
    queen elizabeth
  give me no help in lamentation
  
      i am not barren to bring forth complaints
  
      all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes 
      that i
  being govern d by the watery moon
  
      may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world
  
      ah for my husband
  for my dear lord edward
  
    children
  ah for our father
  for our dear lord clarence
  
    duchess
  alas for both
  both mine
  edward and clarence

      alas

      and i will pamper it with lamentation
  
    dorset
  comfort
  dear mother
  god is much displeas d 
      that you take with unthankfulness his doing
  
      in common worldly things  tis called ungrateful 
      with dull unwillingness to repay a debt 
      which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent
  
      much more to be thus opposite with heaven
  
      for it requires the royal debt it lent you
  
    rivers
  madam
  bethink you
  like a careful mother
  
      of the young prince your son
  send straight for him
  
      let him be crown d
  in him your comfort lives
  
      drown desperate sorrow in dead edward s grave
  
      and plant your joys in living edward s throne
  
   
                 enter gloucester
  buckingham
  derby
  
                        hastings
  and ratcliff 
   
    gloucester
  sister
  have comfort
  all of us have cause 
      to wail the dimming of our shining star
  
      but none can help our harms by wailing them
  
      madam
  my mother
  i do cry you mercy
  
      i did not see your grace
  humbly on my knee 
      i crave your blessing
  
    duchess
  god bless thee
  and put meekness in thy breast
  
      love
  charity
  obedience
  and true duty
  
    gloucester
  amen
    aside   and make me die a good old 
      man
  
      that is the butt end of a mother s blessing
  
      i marvel that her grace did leave it out
  
    buckingham
  you cloudy princes and heart sorrowing 
      peers
  
      that bear this heavy mutual load of moan
  
      now cheer each other in each other s love
  
      though we have spent our harvest of this king
  
      we are to reap the harvest of his son
  
      the broken rancour of your high swol n hearts
  
      but lately splinter d
  knit
  and join d together
  
      must gently be preserv d
  cherish d
  and kept
  
      me seemeth good that
  with some little train
  
      forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fet 
      hither to london
  to be crown d our king
  
   
   rivers
  why with some little train
  my lord of 
      buckingham
  
    buckingham
  marry
  my lord
  lest by a multitude 
      the new heal d wound of malice should break out
  
      which would be so much the more dangerous 
      by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern d
  
      where every horse bears his commanding rein 
      and may direct his course as please himself
  
      as well the fear of harm as harm apparent
  
      in my opinion
  ought to be prevented
  
    gloucester
  i hope the king made peace with all of us
  
      and the compact is firm and true in me
  
    rivers
  and so in me
  and so
  i think
  in an
  
      yet
  since it is but green
  it should be put 
      to no apparent likelihood of breach
  
      which haply by much company might be urg d
  
      therefore i say with noble buckingham 
      that it is meet so few should fetch the prince
  
    hastings
  and so say i
  
    gloucester
  then be it so
  and go we to determine 
      who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow
  
      madam
  and you
  my sister
  will you go 
      to give your censures in this business
  
                          exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester 
    buckingham
  my lord
  whoever journeys to the prince
  
      for god sake
  let not us two stay at home
  
      for by the way i ll sort occasion
  
      as index to the story we late talk d of
  
      to part the queen s proud kindred from the prince

      i
  as a child
  will go by thy direction
  
      toward ludlow then

  scene 3
  
   
  london
  a street 
   
  enter one citizen at one door
  and another at the other 
   
    first citizen
  good morrow
  neighbour
  whither away so 
      fast
  
    second citizen
  i promise you
  i scarcely know myself
  
      hear you the news abroad
  
    first citizen
  yes
  that the king is dead
  
    second citizen
  ill news
  by r lady
  seldom comes the 
      better
  
      i fear
  i fear  twill prove a giddy world
  
   
                          enter another citizen 
   
    third citizen
  neighbours
  god speed
  
    first citizen
  give you good morrow
  sir
  
    third citizen
  doth the news hold of good king edward s 
      death
  
    second citizen
  ay
  sir
  it is too true
  god help the while
  
    third citizen
  then
  masters
  look to see a troublous 
      world
  
    first citizen
  no
  no
  by god s good grace
  his son shall 
      reign
  
    third citizen
  woe to that land that s govern d by a child
  
    second citizen
  in him there is a hope of government
  
      which
  in his nonage
  council under him
  
      and
  in his full and ripened years
  himself
  
      no doubt
  shall then
  and till then
  govern well
  
    first citizen
  so stood the state when henry the sixth 
      was crown d in paris but at nine months old
  
    third citizen
  stood the state so
  no
  no
  good friends
  
      god wot
  
      for then this land was famously enrich d 
      with politic grave counsel
  then the king 
      had virtuous uncles to protect his grace
  
    first citizen
  why
  so hath this
  both by his father and 
      mother
  
    third citizen
  better it were they all came by his father
  
      or by his father there were none at all
  
      for emulation who shall now be nearest 
      will touch us all too near
  if god prevent not
  
      o
  full of danger is the duke of gloucester
  
      and the queen s sons and brothers haught and proud
  
      and were they to be rul d
  and not to rule
  
      this sickly land might solace as before
  
    first citizen
  come
  come
  we fear the worst
  all will be 
      well
  
    third citizen
  when clouds are seen
  wise men put on 
      their cloaks
  
      when great leaves fall
  then winter is at hand
  
      when the sun sets
  who doth not look for night
  
      untimely storms make men expect a dearth
  
      all may be well
  but
  if god sort it so
  
       tis more than we deserve or i expect
  
    second citizen
  truly
  the hearts of men are fun of fear
  
      you cannot reason almost with a man 
      that looks not heavily and fun of dread
  
    third citizen
  before the days of change
  still is it so
  
      by a divine instinct men s minds mistrust 
      ensuing danger
  as by proof we see 
      the water swell before a boist rous storm
  
      but leave it all to god
  whither away
  
    second citizen
  marry
  we were sent for to the justices
  
    third citizen
  and so was i
  i ll bear you company

  scene 4
  
   
  london
  the palace 
   
  enter the archbishop of york
  the young duke of york
  queen 
  elizabeth
  
  and the duchess of york 
   
    archbishop
  last night
  i hear
  they lay at stony stratford
  
      and at northampton they do rest to night
  
      to morrow or next day they will be here
  
    duchess
  i long with all my heart to see the prince
  
      i hope he is much grown since last i saw him
  
    queen elizabeth
  but i hear no
  they say my son of york 
      has almost overta en him in his growth
  
    york
  ay
  mother
  but i would not have it so
  
    duchess
  why
  my good cousin
  it is good to grow
  
    york
  grandam
  one night as we did sit at supper
  
      my uncle rivers talk d how i did grow 
      more than my brother
   ay
   quoth my uncle gloucester 
       small herbs have grace
  great weeds do grow apace
   
      and since
  methinks
  i would not grow so fast
  
      because sweet flow rs are slow and weeds make haste
  
    duchess
  good faith
  good faith
  the saying did not hold 
      in him that did object the same to thee
  
      he was the wretched st thing when he was young
  
      so long a growing and so leisurely 
      that
  if his rule were true
  he should be gracious
  
    archbishop
  and so no doubt he is
  my gracious madam
  
    duchess
  i hope he is
  but yet let mothers doubt
  
    york
  now
  by my troth
  if i had been rememb red
  
      i could have given my uncle s grace a flout 
      to touch his growth nearer than he touch d mine
  
    duchess
  how
  my young york
  i prithee let me hear it
  
    york
  marry
  they say my uncle grew so fast 
      that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
  
       twas full two years ere i could get a tooth
  
      grandam
  this would have been a biting jest
  
    duchess
  i prithee
  pretty york
  who told thee this
  
    york
  grandam
  his nurse
  
    duchess
  his nurse
  why she was dead ere thou wast 
      born
  
    york
  if  twere not she
  i cannot tell who told me
  
    queen elizabeth
  a parlous boy
  go to
  you are too 
      shrewd
  
    archbishop
  good madam

      is all unknown to me
  my gracious lord
  
    queen elizabeth
  ay me
  i see the ruin of my house
  
      the tiger now hath seiz d the gentle hind
  
      insulting tyranny begins to jet 
      upon the innocent and aweless throne
  
      welcome
  destruction
  blood
  and massacre
  
      i see
  as in a map
  the end of all
  
    duchess
  accursed and unquiet wrangling days
  
      how many of you have mine eyes beheld
  
      my husband lost his life to get the crown
  
      and often up and down my sons were toss d 
      for me to joy and weep their gain and loss
  
      and being seated
  and domestic broils 
      clean over blown
  themselves the conquerors 
      make war upon themselves brother to brother
  
      blood to blood
  self against self

  preposterous 
      and frantic outrage
  end thy damned spleen
  
      or let me die
  to look on death no more

  london
  a street 
   
  the trumpets sound
  enter the prince of wales
  gloucester
  
  buckingham
  
  catesby
  cardinal bourchier
  and others 
   
    buckingham
  welcome
  sweet prince
  to london
  to your 
      chamber
  
    gloucester
  welcome
  dear cousin
  my thoughts  sovereign
  
      the weary way hath made you melancholy
  
    prince
  no
  uncle
  but our crosses on the way 
      have made it tedious
  wearisome
  and heavy
  
      i want more uncles here to welcome me
  
    gloucester
  sweet prince
  the untainted virtue of your 
      years 
      hath not yet div d into the world s deceit
  
      nor more can you distinguish of a man 
      than of his outward show
  which
  god he knows
  
      seldom or never jumpeth with the heart
  
      those uncles which you want were dangerous
  
      your grace attended to their sug red words 
      but look d not on the poison of their hearts
  
      god keep you from them and from such false friends
  
    prince
  god keep me from false friends
  but they were 
      none
  
    gloucester
  my lord
  the mayor of london comes to greet 
      you
  
   
                  enter the lord mayor and his train 
   
    mayor
  god bless your grace with health and happy days
  
    prince
  i thank you
  good my lord
  and thank you all
  
      i thought my mother and my brother york 
      would long ere this have met us on the way
  
      fie
  what a slug is hastings
  that he comes not 
      to tell us whether they will come or no
  
   
                          enter lord hastings 
   
    buckingham
  and
  in good time
  here comes the sweating 
      lord
  
    prince
  welcome
  my lord
  what
  will our mother come
  
    hastings
  on what occasion
  god he knows
  not i
  
      the queen your mother and your brother york 
      have taken sanctuary
  the tender prince 
      would fain have come with me to meet your grace
  
      but by his mother was perforce withheld
  
    buckingham
  fie
  what an indirect and peevish course 
      is this of hers
  lord cardinal
  will your grace 
      persuade the queen to send the duke of york 
      unto his princely brother presently
  
      if she deny
  lord hastings
  go with him 
      and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce
  
    cardinal
  my lord of buckingham
  if my weak oratory 
      can from his mother win the duke of york
  
      anon expect him here
  but if she be obdurate 
      to mild entreaties
  god in heaven forbid 
      we should infringe the holy privilege 
      of blessed sanctuary
  not for all this land 
      would i be guilty of so deep a sin
  
    buckingham
  you are too senseless obstinate
  my lord
  
      too ceremonious and traditional
  
      weigh it but with the grossness of this age
  
      you break not sanctuary in seizing him
  
      the benefit thereof is always granted 
      to those whose dealings have deserv d the place 
      and those who have the wit to claim the place
  
      this prince hath neither claim d it nor deserv d it
  
      and therefore
  in mine opinion
  cannot have it
  
      then
  taking him from thence that is not there
  
      you break no privilege nor charter there
  
      oft have i heard of sanctuary men
  
      but sanctuary children never till now
  
    cardinal
  my lord
  you shall o errule my mind for once
  
      come on
  lord hastings
  will you go with me
  
    hastings
  i go
  my lord
  
    prince
  good lords
  make all the speedy haste you may
  
                                      exeunt cardinal and hastings 
      say
  uncle gloucester
  if our brother come
  
      where shall we sojourn till our coronation
  
    gloucester
  where it seems best unto your royal self
  
      if i may counsel you
  some day or two 
      your highness shall repose you at the tower
  
      then where you please and shall be thought most fit 
      for your best health and recreation
  
    prince
  i do not like the tower
  of any place
  
      did julius caesar build that place
  my lord
  
    buckingham
  he did
  my gracious lord
  begin that place
  
      which
  since
  succeeding ages have re edified
  
    prince
  is it upon record
  or else reported 
      successively from age to age
  he built it
  
    buckingham
  upon record
  my gracious lord
  
    prince
  but say
  my lord
  it were not regist red
  
      methinks the truth should eve from age to age
  
      as  twere retail d to all posterity
  
      even to the general all ending day
  
    gloucester
    aside   so wise so young
  they say
  do never 
      live long
  
    prince
  what say you
  uncle
  
    gloucester
  i say
  without characters
  fame lives long
  
       aside   thus
  like the formal vice
  iniquity
  
      i moralize two meanings in one word
  
    prince
  that julius caesar was a famous man
  
      with what his valour did enrich his wit
  
      his wit set down to make his valour live
  
      death makes no conquest of this conqueror
  
      for now he lives in fame
  though not in life
  
      i ll tell you what
  my cousin buckingham  
    buckingham
  what
  my gracious lord
  
    prince
  an if i live until i be a man
  
      i ll win our ancient right in france again
  
      or die a soldier as i liv d a king
  
    gloucester
    aside   short summers lightly have a forward 
      spring
  
   
                enter hastings
  young york
  and the cardinal 
   
    buckingham
  now
  in good time
  here comes the duke of 
      york
  
    prince
  richard of york
  how fares our loving brother
  
    york
  well
  my dread lord
  so must i can you now
  
    prince
  ay brother
  to our grief
  as it is yours
  
      too late he died that might have kept that title
  
      which by his death hath lost much majesty
  
    gloucester
  how fares our cousin
  noble lord of york
  
    york
  i thank you
  gentle uncle
  o
  my lord
  
      you said that idle weeds are fast in growth
  
      the prince my brother hath outgrown me far
  
    gloucester
  he hath
  my lord
  
    york
  and therefore is he idle
  
    gloucester
  o
  my fair cousin
  i must not say so
  
    york
  then he is more beholding to you than i
  
    gloucester
  he may command me as my sovereign
  
      but you have power in me as in a kinsman
  
    york
  i pray you
  uncle
  give me this dagger
  
    gloucester
  my dagger
  little cousin
  with all my heart
  
    prince
  a beggar
  brother
  
    york
  of my kind uncle
  that i know will give
  
      and being but a toy
  which is no grief to give
  
    gloucester
  a greater gift than that i ll give my cousin
  
    york
  a greater gift
  o
  that s the sword to it
  
    gloucester
  ay
  gentle cousin
  were it light enough
  
    york
  o
  then
  i see you will part but with light gifts
  
      in weightier things you ll say a beggar nay
  
    gloucester
  it is too heavy for your grace to wear
  
    york
  i weigh it lightly
  were it heavier
  
    gloucester
  what
  would you have my weapon
  little 
      lord
  
    york
  i would
  that i might thank you as you call me
  
    gloucester
  how
  
    york
  little
  
    prince
  my lord of york will still be cross in talk
  
      uncle
  your grace knows how to bear with him
  
    york
  you mean
  to bear me
  not to bear with me
  
      uncle
  my brother mocks both you and me
  
      because that i am little
  like an ape
  
      he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders
  
    buckingham
  with what a sharp provided wit he reasons
  
      to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle 
      he prettily and aptly taunts himself
  
      so cunning and so young is wonderful
  
    gloucester
  my lord
  will t please you pass along
  
      myself and my good cousin buckingham 
      will to your mother
  to entreat of her 
      to meet you at the tower and welcome you
  
    york
  what
  will you go unto the tower
  my lord
  
    prince
  my lord protector needs will have it so
  
    york
  i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower
  
    gloucester
  why
  what should you fear
  
    york
  marry
  my uncle clarence  angry ghost
  
      my grandam told me he was murder d there
  
    prince
  i fear no uncles dead
  
    gloucester
  nor none that live
  i hope
  
    prince
  an if they live
  i hope i need not fear
  
      but come
  my lord
  and with a heavy heart
  
      thinking on them
  go i unto the tower
  
      a sennet
  
                exeunt all but gloucester
  buckingham
  and catesby 
    buckingham
  think you
  my lord
  this little prating york 
      was not incensed by his subtle mother 
      to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously
  
    gloucester
  no doubt
  no doubt
  o
   tis a perilous boy
  
      bold
  quick
  ingenious
  forward
  capable
  
      he is all the mother s
  from the top to toe
  
    buckingham
  well
  let them rest
  come hither
  catesby
  
      thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend 
      as closely to conceal what we impart
  
      thou know st our reasons urg d upon the way
  
      what think st thou
  is it not an easy matter 
      to make william lord hastings of our mind
  
      for the instalment of this noble duke 
      in the seat royal of this famous isle
  
    catesby
  he for his father s sake so loves the prince 
      that he will not be won to aught against him
  
    buckingham
  what think st thou then of stanley
  will 
      not he
  
    catesby
  he will do all in all as hastings doth
  
    buckingham
  well then
  no more but this
  go
  gentle 
      catesby
  
      and
  as it were far off
  sound thou lord hastings 
      how he doth stand affected to our purpose
  
      and summon him to morrow to the tower
  
      to sit about the coronation
  
      if thou dost find him tractable to us
  
      encourage him
  and tell him all our reasons
  
      if he be leaden
  icy
  cold
  unwilling
  
      be thou so too
  and so break off the talk
  
      and give us notice of his inclination
  
      for we to morrow hold divided councils
  
      wherein thyself shalt highly be employ d
  
    gloucester
  commend me to lord william
  tell him
  
      catesby
  
      his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries 
      to morrow are let blood at pomfret castle
  
      and bid my lord
  for joy of this good news
  
      give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more
  
    buckingham
  good catesby
  go effect this business soundly
  
    catesby
  my good lords both
  with all the heed i can
  
    gloucester
  shall we hear from you
  catesby
  ere we sleep
  
    catesby
  you shall
  my lord
  
    gloucester
  at crosby house
  there shall you find us both
  
                                                      exit catesby 
    buckingham
  now
  my lord
  what shall we do if we 
      perceive 
      lord hastings will not yield to our complots
  
    gloucester
  chop off his head something we will 
      determine
  
      and
  look when i am king
  claim thou of me

    messenger
  my lord
  my lord
                          knocking  
    hastings
    within   who knocks
  
    messenger
  one from the lord stanley
  
    hastings
    within   what is t o clock
  
    messenger
  upon the stroke of four
  
   
                          enter lord hastings 
   
    hastings
  cannot my lord stanley sleep these tedious 
      nights
  
    messenger
  so it appears by that i have to say
  
      first
  he commends him to your noble self
  
    hastings
  what then
  
    messenger
  then certifies your lordship that this night 
      he dreamt the boar had razed off his helm
  
      besides
  he says there are two councils kept
  
      and that may be determin d at the one 
      which may make you and him to rue at th  other
  
      therefore he sends to know your lordship s pleasure  
      if you will presently take horse with him 
      and with all speed post with him toward the north 
      to shun the danger that his soul divines
  
    hastings
  go
  fellow
  go
  return unto thy lord
  
      bid him not fear the separated council
  
      his honour and myself are at the one
  
      and at the other is my good friend catesby
  
      where nothing can proceed that toucheth us 
      whereof i shall not have intelligence
  
      tell him his fears are shallow
  without instance
  
      and for his dreams
  i wonder he s so simple 
      to trust the mock ry of unquiet slumbers
  
      to fly the boar before the boar pursues 
      were to incense the boar to follow us 
      and make pursuit where he did mean no chase
  
      go
  bid thy master rise and come to me
  
      and we will both together to the tower
  
      where
  he shall see
  the boar will use us kindly
  
    messenger
  i ll go
  my lord
  and tell him what you say
  
   exit 
   
                           enter catesby 
   
    catesby
  many good morrows to my noble lord
  
    hastings
  good morrow
  catesby
  you are early stirring
  
      what news
  what news
  in this our tott ring state
  
    catesby
  it is a reeling world indeed
  my lord
  
      and i believe will never stand upright 
      till richard wear the garland of the realm
  
    hastings
  how
  wear the garland
  dost thou mean the 
      crown
  
    catesby
  ay
  my good lord
  
    hastings
  i ll have this crown of mine cut from my 
      shoulders 
      before i ll see the crown so foul misplac d
  
      but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it
  
    catesby
  ay
  on my life
  and hopes to find you forward 
      upon his party for the gain thereof
  
      and thereupon he sends you this good news
  
      that this same very day your enemies
  
      the kindred of the queen
  must die at pomfret
  
    hastings
  indeed
  i am no mourner for that news
  
      because they have been still my adversaries
  
      but that i ll give my voice on richard s side 
      to bar my master s heirs in true descent
  
      god knows i will not do it to the death
  
    catesby
  god keep your lordship in that gracious mind
  
    hastings
  but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence
  
      that they which brought me in my master s hate
  
      i live to look upon their tragedy
  
      well
  catesby
  ere a fortnight make me older
  
      i ll send some packing that yet think not on t
  
    catesby
   tis a vile thing to die
  my gracious lord
  
      when men are unprepar d and look not for it
  
    hastings
  o monstrous
  monstrous
  and so falls it out 
      with rivers
  vaughan
  grey
  and so  twill do 
      with some men else that think themselves as safe 
      as thou and i
  who
  as thou knowest
  are dear 
      to princely richard and to buckingham
  
    catesby
  the princes both make high account of you  
       aside   for they account his head upon the bridge
  
    hastings
  i know they do
  and i have well deserv d it
  
   
                        enter lord stanley

      and never in my days
  i do protest
  
      was it so precious to me as  tis now

      his gracious pleasure any way therein
  
      but you
  my honourable lords

    william lord hastings had pronounc d your part

  so dear i lov d the man that i must weep
  
      i took him for the plainest harmless creature 
      that breath d upon the earth a christian
  
      made him my book
  wherein my soul recorded 
      the history of all her secret thoughts
  
      so smooth he daub d his vice with show of virtue 
      that
  his apparent open guilt omitted
  
      i mean his conversation with shore s wife  
      he liv d from all attainder of suspects

  well
  well
  he was the covert st shelt red 
      traitor 
      that ever liv d
  
      would you imagine

      were t not that by great preservation

      to murder me and my good lord of gloucester

  had he done so

  what
  think you we are turks or infidels

  fair befall you
  he deserv d his death
  
      and your good graces both have well proceeded 
      to warn false traitors from the like attempts
  
      i never look d for better at his hands 
      after he once fell in with mistress shore
  
    buckingham
  yet had we not determin d he should die 
      until your lordship came to see his end  
      which now the loving haste of these our friends
  
      something against our meanings
  have prevented  
      because
  my lord
  i would have had you heard 
      the traitor speak
  and timorously confess 
      the manner and the purpose of his treasons
  
      that you might well have signified the same 
      unto the citizens
  who haply may 
      misconster us in him and wail his death
  
    mayor
  but
  my good lord
  your grace s words shall serve 
      as well as i had seen and heard him speak

      only for saying he would make his son 
      heir to the crown meaning indeed his house
  
      which by the sign thereof was termed so
  
      moreover
  urge his hateful luxury 
      and bestial appetite in change of lust
  
      which stretch d unto their servants
  daughters
  wives
  
      even where his raging eye or savage heart 
      without control lusted to make a prey
  
      nay

  when that my mother went with child 
      of that insatiate edward
  noble york 
      my princely father then had wars in france 
      and
  by true computation of the time
  
      found that the issue was not his begot
  
      which well appeared in his lineaments
  
      being nothing like the noble duke my father
  
      yet touch this sparingly
  as  twere far off
  
      because

    gloucester
  how now
  how now
  what say the citizens
  
    buckingham
  now
  by the holy mother of our lord
  
      the citizens are mum
  say not a word
  
    gloucester
  touch d you the bastardy of edward s 
      children
  
    buckingham
  i did
  with his contract with lady lucy
  
      and his contract by deputy in france
  
      th  insatiate greediness of his desire
  
      and his enforcement of the city wives
  
      his tyranny for trifles
  his own bastardy
  
      as being got
  your father then in france
  
      and his resemblance
  being not like the duke
  
      withal i did infer your lineaments
  
      being the right idea of your father
  
      both in your form and nobleness of mind
  
      laid open all your victories in scotland
  
      your discipline in war
  wisdom in peace
  
      your bounty
  virtue
  fair humility
  
      indeed
  left nothing fitting for your purpose 
      untouch d or slightly handled in discourse
  
      and when mine oratory drew toward end 
      i bid them that did love their country s good 
      cry  god save richard
  england s royal king
   
    gloucester
  and did they so
  
    buckingham
  no
  so god help me
  they spake not a word
  
      but
  like dumb statues or breathing stones
  
      star d each on other
  and look d deadly pale
  
      which when i saw
  i reprehended them
  
      and ask d the mayor what meant this wilfull silence
  
      his answer was
  the people were not used 
      to be spoke to but by the recorder
  
      then he was urg d to tell my tale again
  
       thus saith the duke
  thus hath the duke inferr d   
      but nothing spoke in warrant from himself
  
      when he had done
  some followers of mine own 
      at lower end of the hall hurl d up their caps
  
      and some ten voices cried  god save king richard
   
      and thus i took the vantage of those few  
       thanks
  gentle citizens and friends
   quoth i 
       this general applause and cheerful shout 
      argues your wisdoms and your love to richard
   
      and even here brake off and came away
  
    gloucester
  what
  tongueless blocks were they
  would 
      they not speak
  
      will not the mayor then and his brethren come
  
    buckingham
  the mayor is here at hand
  intend some fear
  
      be not you spoke with but by mighty suit
  
      and look you get a prayer book in your hand
  
      and stand between two churchmen
  good my lord
  
      for on that ground i ll make a holy descant
  
      and be not easily won to our requests
  
      play the maid s part
  still answer nay
  and take it
  
    gloucester
  i go
  and if you plead as well for them 
      as i can say nay to thee for myself
  
      no doubt we bring it to a happy issue
  
    buckingham
  go
  go
  up to the leads
  the lord mayor 
      knocks
                                       exit gloucester 
   
             enter the lord mayor
  aldermen
  and citizens 
   
      welcome

      now
  catesby
  what says your lord to my request
  
    catesby
  he doth entreat your grace
  my noble lord
  
      to visit him to morrow or next day
  
      he is within
  with two right reverend fathers
  
      divinely bent to meditation
  
      and in no worldly suits would he be mov d
  
      to draw him from his holy exercise
  
    buckingham
  return
  good catesby
  to the gracious duke
  
      tell him
  myself
  the mayor and aldermen
  
      in deep designs
  in matter of great moment
  
      no less importing than our general good
  
      are come to have some conference with his grace
  
    catesby
  i ll signify so much unto him straight
           exit 
    buckingham
  ah ha
  my lord
  this prince is not an edward
  
      he is not lolling on a lewd love bed
  
      but on his knees at meditation
  
      not dallying with a brace of courtezans
  
      but meditating with two deep divines
  
      not sleeping
  to engross his idle body
  
      but praying
  to enrich his watchful soul
  
      happy were england would this virtuous prince 
      take on his grace the sovereignty thereof
  
      but
  sure
  i fear we shall not win him to it
  
    mayor
  marry
  god defend his grace should say us nay
  
    buckingham
  i fear he will
  here catesby comes again
  
   
                            re enter catesby 
   
      now
  catesby
  what says his grace
  
    catesby
  my lord
  
      he wonders to what end you have assembled 
      such troops of citizens to come to him
  
      his grace not being warn d thereof before
  
      he fears
  my lord
  you mean no good to him
  
    buckingham
  sorry i am my noble cousin should 
      suspect me that i mean no good to him
  
      by heaven
  we come to him in perfect love
  
      and so once more return and tell his grace
  
                                                      exit catesby 
      when holy and devout religious men 
      are at their beads
   tis much to draw them thence
  
      so sweet is zealous contemplation
  
   
             enter gloucester aloft
  between two bishops
  
                        catesby returns 
   
    mayor
  see where his grace stands  tween two clergymen
  
    buckingham
  two props of virtue for a christian prince
  
      to stay him from the fall of vanity
  
      and
  see
  a book of prayer in his hand
  
      true ornaments to know a holy man
  
      famous plantagenet
  most gracious prince
  
      lend favourable ear to our requests
  
      and pardon us the interruption 
      of thy devotion and right christian zeal
  
    gloucester
  my lord
  there needs no such apology
  
      i do beseech your grace to pardon me
  
      who
  earnest in the service of my god
  
      deferr d the visitation of my friends
  
      but
  leaving this
  what is your grace s pleasure
  
    buckingham
  even that
  i hope
  which pleaseth god above
  
      and all good men of this ungovern d isle
  
    gloucester
  i do suspect i have done some offence 
      that seems disgracious in the city s eye
  
      and that you come to reprehend my ignorance
  
    buckingham
  you have
  my lord
  would it might please 
      your grace
  
      on our entreaties
  to amend your fault
  
    gloucester
  else wherefore breathe i in a christian land
  
    buckingham
  know then
  it is your fault that you resign 
      the supreme seat
  the throne majestical
  
      the scept red office of your ancestors
  
      your state of fortune and your due of birth
  
      the lineal glory of your royal house
  
      to the corruption of a blemish d stock
  
      whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts
  
      which here we waken to our country s good
  
      the noble isle doth want her proper limbs
  
      her face defac d with scars of infamy
  
      her royal stock graft with ignoble plants
  
      and almost should red in the swallowing gulf 
      of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion
  
      which to recure
  we heartily solicit 
      your gracious self to take on you the charge 
      and kingly government of this your land  
      not as protector
  steward
  substitute
  
      or lowly factor for another s gain
  
      but as successively
  from blood to blood
  
      your right of birth
  your empery
  your own
  
      for this
  consorted with the citizens
  
      your very worshipful and loving friends
  
      and by their vehement instigation
  
      in this just cause come i to move your grace
  
    gloucester
  i cannot tell if to depart in silence 
      or bitterly to speak in your reproof 
      best fitteth my degree or your condition
  
      if not to answer
  you might haply think 
      tongue tied ambition
  not replying
  yielded 
      to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty
  
      which fondly you would here impose on me
  
      if to reprove you for this suit of yours
  
      so season d with your faithful love to me
  
      then
  on the other side
  i check d my friends
  
      therefore to speak
  and to avoid the first
  
      and then
  in speaking
  not to incur the last  
      definitively thus i answer you
  
      your love deserves my thanks
  but my desert 
      unmeritable shuns your high request
  
      first
  if all obstacles were cut away
  
      and that my path were even to the crown
  
      as the ripe revenue and due of birth
  
      yet so much is my poverty of spirit
  
      so mighty and so many my defects
  
      that i would rather hide me from my greatness  
      being a bark to brook no mighty sea  
      than in my greatness covet to be hid
  
      and in the vapour of my glory smother d
  
      but
  god be thank d
  there is no need of me  
      and much i need to help you
  were there need
  
      the royal tree hath left us royal fruit 
      which
  mellow d by the stealing hours of time
  
      will well become the seat of majesty 
      and make
  no doubt
  us happy by his reign
  
      on him i lay that you would lay on me  
      the right and fortune of his happy stars
  
      which god defend that i should wring from him
  
    buckingham
  my lord
  this argues conscience in your 
      grace
  
      but the respects thereof are nice and trivial
  
      all circumstances well considered
  
      you say that edward is your brother s son
  
      so say we too
  but not by edward s wife
  
      for first was he contract to lady lucy  
      your mother lives a witness to his vow  
      and afterward by substitute betroth d 
      to bona
  sister to the king of france
  
      these both put off
  a poor petitioner
  
      a care craz d mother to a many sons
  
      a beauty waning and distressed widow
  
      even in the afternoon of her best days
  
      made prize and purchase of his wanton eye
  
      seduc d the pitch and height of his degree 
      to base declension and loath d bigamy
  
      by her
  in his unlawful bed
  he got 
      this edward
  whom our manners call the prince
  
      more bitterly could i expostulate
  
      save that
  for reverence to some alive
  
      i give a sparing limit to my tongue
  
      then
  good my lord
  take to your royal self 
      this proffer d benefit of dignity
  
      if not to bless us and the land withal
  
      yet to draw forth your noble ancestry 
      from the corruption of abusing times 
      unto a lineal true derived course
  
    mayor
  do
  good my lord
  your citizens entreat you
  
    buckingham
  refuse not
  mighty lord
  this proffer d love
  
    catesby
  o
  make them joyful
  grant their lawful suit
  
    gloucester
  alas
  why would you heap this care on me
  
      i am unfit for state and majesty
  
      i do beseech you
  take it not amiss
  
      i cannot nor i will not yield to you
  
    buckingham
  if you refuse it as
  in love and zeal
  
      loath to depose the child
  your brother s son
  
      as well we know your tenderness of heart 
      and gentle
  kind
  effeminate remorse
  
      which we have noted in you to your kindred 
      and egally indeed to all estates  
      yet know
  whe er you accept our suit or no
  
      your brother s son shall never reign our king
  
      but we will plant some other in the throne 
      to the disgrace and downfall of your house
  
      and in this resolution here we leave you
  
      come
  citizens
  zounds
  i ll entreat no more
  
    gloucester
  o
  do not swear
  my lord of buckingham
  
                            exeunt buckingham
  mayor
  and citizens 
    catesby
  call him again
  sweet prince
  accept their suit
  
      if you deny them
  all the land will rue it
  
    gloucester
  will you enforce me to a world of cares
  
      call them again
  i am not made of stones
  
      but penetrable to your kind entreaties
  
      albeit against my conscience and my soul
  
   
                    re enter buckingham and the rest 
   
      cousin of buckingham
  and sage grave men
  
      since you will buckle fortune on my back
  
      to bear her burden
  whe er i will or no
  
      i must have patience to endure the load
  
      but if black scandal or foul fac d reproach 
      attend the sequel of your imposition
  
      your mere enforcement shall acquittance me 
      from all the impure blots and stains thereof
  
      for god doth know
  and you may partly see
  
      how far i am from the desire of this
  
    mayor
  god bless your grace
  we see it
  and will say it
  
    gloucester
  in saying so
  you shall but say the truth
  
    buckingham
  then i salute you with this royal title  
      long live king richard
  england s worthy king
  
    all
  amen
  
    buckingham
  to morrow may it please you to be crown d
  
    gloucester
  even when you please
  for you will have it so
  
    buckingham
  to morrow
  then
  we will attend your grace
  
      and so
  most joyfully
  we take our leave
  
    gloucester
    to the bishops   come
  let us to our holy 
      work again
  
      farewell

      which hitherto hath held my eyes from rest
  
      for never yet one hour in his bed 
      did i enjoy the golden dew of sleep

      to have him suddenly convey d from hence
  
      cancel his bond of life
  dear god
  i pray
  
      that i may live and say  the dog is dead
   
    queen elizabeth
  o
  thou didst prophesy the time would 
        come 
      that i should wish for thee to help me curse 
      that bottled spider
  that foul bunch back d toad
  
    queen margaret
  i call d thee then vain flourish of my 
        fortune
  
      i call d thee then poor shadow
  painted queen
  
      the presentation of but what i was
  
      the flattering index of a direful pageant
  
      one heav d a high to be hurl d down below
  
      a mother only mock d with two fair babes
  
      a dream of what thou wast
  a garish flag 
      to be the aim of every dangerous shot
  
      a sign of dignity
  a breath
  a bubble
  
      a queen in jest
  only to fill the scene
  
      where is thy husband now
  where be thy brothers
  
      where be thy two sons
  wherein dost thou joy
  
      who sues
  and kneels
  and says  god save the queen 
  
      where be the bending peers that flattered thee
  
      where be the thronging troops that followed thee
  
      decline an this
  and see what now thou art
  
      for happy wife
  a most distressed widow
  
      for joyful mother
  one that wails the name
  
      for one being su d to
  one that humbly sues
  
      for queen
  a very caitiff crown d with care
  
      for she that scorn d at me
  now scorn d of me
  
      for she being fear d of all
  now fearing one
  
      for she commanding all
  obey d of none
  
      thus hath the course of justice whirl d about 
      and left thee but a very prey to time
  
      having no more but thought of what thou wast 
      to torture thee the more
  being what thou art
  
      thou didst usurp my place
  and dost thou not 
      usurp the just proportion of my sorrow
  
      now thy proud neck bears half my burden d yoke
  
      from which even here i slip my weary head 
      and leave the burden of it all on thee
  
      farewell
  york s wife
  and queen of sad mischance
  
      these english woes shall make me smile in france
  
    queen elizabeth
  o thou well skill d in curses
  stay awhile 
      and teach me how to curse mine enemies
  
    queen margaret
  forbear to sleep the nights
  and fast the 
        days
  
      compare dead happiness with living woe
  
      think that thy babes were sweeter than they were
  
      and he that slew them fouler than he is
  
      bett ring thy loss makes the bad causer worse
  
      revolving this will teach thee how to curse
  
    queen elizabeth
  my words are dull
  o
  quicken them 
      with thine
  
    queen margaret
  thy woes will make them sharp and 
      pierce like mine
                                        exit 
    duchess
  why should calamity be fun of words
  
    queen elizabeth
  windy attorneys to their client woes
  
      airy succeeders of intestate joys
  
      poor breathing orators of miseries
  
      let them have scope
  though what they will impart 
      help nothing else
  yet do they case the heart
  
    duchess
  if so
  then be not tongue tied
  go with me
  
      and in the breath of bitter words let s smother 
      my damned son that thy two sweet sons smother d

      crown

    duchess
  i will be mild and gentle in my words

  thou know st it well 
      thou cam st on earth to make the earth my hell
  
      a grievous burden was thy birth to me
  
      tetchy and wayward was thy infancy

  and venturous
  
      thy age confirm d

  and bloody
  
      more mild

  none but humphrey hour
  that call d 
      your grace 
      to breakfast once forth of my company

    king richard
  so
  
    duchess
  either thou wilt die by god s just ordinance 
      ere from this war thou turn a conqueror
  
      or i with grief and extreme age shall perish 
      and never more behold thy face again
  
      therefore take with thee my most grievous curse
  
      which in the day of battle tire thee more 
      than all the complete armour that thou wear st
  
      my prayers on the adverse party fight
  
      and there the little souls of edward s children 
      whisper the spirits of thine enemies 
      and promise them success and victory
  
      bloody thou art
  bloody will be thy end
  
      shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend
         exit 
    queen elizabeth
  though far more cause
  yet much less 
        spirit to curse 
      abides in me
  i say amen to her
  
    king richard
  stay
  madam
  i must talk a word with you
  
    queen elizabeth
  i have no moe sons of the royal blood 
      for thee to slaughter
  for my daughters
  richard
  
      they shall be praying nuns
  not weeping queens
  
      and therefore level not to hit their lives
  
    king richard
  you have a daughter call d elizabeth
  
      virtuous and fair
  royal and gracious
  
    queen elizabeth
  and must she die for this
  o
  let her 
        live
  
      and i ll corrupt her manners
  stain her beauty
  
      slander myself as false to edward s bed
  
      throw over her the veil of infamy
  
      so she may live unscarr d of bleeding slaughter
  
      i will confess she was not edward s daughter
  
    king richard
  wrong not her birth
  she is a royal 
      princess
  
    queen elizabeth
  to save her life i ll say she is not so
  
    king richard
  her life is safest only in her birth
  
    queen elizabeth
  and only in that safety died her 
        brothers
  
    king richard
  lo
  at their birth good stars were opposite
  
    queen elizabeth
  no
  to their lives ill friends were 
        contrary
  
    king richard
  all unavoided is the doom of destiny
  
    queen elizabeth
  true
  when avoided grace makes destiny
  
      my babes were destin d to a fairer death
  
      if grace had bless d thee with a fairer life
  
    king richard
  you speak as if that i had slain my cousins
  
    queen elizabeth
  cousins
  indeed
  and by their uncle 
        cozen d 
      of comfort
  kingdom
  kindred
  freedom
  life
  
      whose hand soever lanc d their tender hearts
  
      thy head
  an indirectly
  gave direction
  
      no doubt the murd rous knife was dull and blunt 
      till it was whetted on thy stone hard heart 
      to revel in the entrails of my lambs
  
      but that stiff use of grief makes wild grief tame
  
      my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys 
      till that my nails were anchor d in thine eyes
  
      and i
  in such a desp rate bay of death
  
      like a poor bark
  of sails and tackling reft
  
      rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom
  
    king richard
  madam
  so thrive i in my enterprise 
      and dangerous success of bloody wars
  
      as i intend more good to you and yours 
      than ever you or yours by me were harm d

  that can do me good
  
    king richard
  advancement of your children
  gentle 
      lady
  
    queen elizabeth
  up to some scaffold
  there to lose their 
      heads
  
    king richard
  unto the dignity and height of fortune
  
      the high imperial type of this earth s glory
  
    queen elizabeth
  flatter my sorrow with report of it
  
      tell me what state
  what dignity
  what honour
  
      canst thou demise to any child of mine
  
    king richard
  even all i have ay
  and myself and all 
      will i withal endow a child of thine
  
      so in the lethe of thy angry soul 
      thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs 
      which thou supposest i have done to thee
  
    queen elizabeth
  be brief
  lest that the process of thy 
        kindness 
      last longer telling than thy kindness  date
  
    king richard
  then know
  that from my soul i love thy 
      daughter
  
    queen elizabeth
  my daughter s mother thinks it with her 
      soul
  
    king richard
  what do you think
  
    queen elizabeth
  that thou dost love my daughter from 
        thy soul
  
      so from thy soul s love didst thou love her brothers
  
      and from my heart s love i do thank thee for it
  
    king richard
  be not so hasty to confound my meaning
  
      i mean that with my soul i love thy daughter 
      and do intend to make her queen of england
  
    queen elizabeth
  well
  then
  who dost thou mean shall be 
      her king
  
    king richard
  even he that makes her queen
  who else 
      should be
  
    queen elizabeth
  what
  thou
  
    king richard
  even so
  how think you of it
  
    queen elizabeth
  how canst thou woo her
  
    king richard
  that would i learn of you
  
      as one being best acquainted with her humour
  
    queen elizabeth
  and wilt thou learn of me
  
    king richard
  madam
  with all my heart
  
    queen elizabeth
  send to her
  by the man that slew her 
      brothers
  
      a pair of bleeding hearts
  thereon engrave 
       edward  and  york
   then haply will she weep
  
      therefore present to her as sometimes margaret 
      did to thy father
  steep d in rutland s blood  
      a handkerchief
  which
  say to her
  did drain 
      the purple sap from her sweet brother s body
  
      and bid her wipe her weeping eyes withal
  
      if this inducement move her not to love
  
      send her a letter of thy noble deeds
  
      tell her thou mad st away her uncle clarence
  
      her uncle rivers
  ay
  and for her sake 
      mad st quick conveyance with her good aunt anne
  
    king richard
  you mock me
  madam
  this is not the way 
      to win your daughter
  
    queen elizabeth
  there is no other way
  
      unless thou couldst put on some other shape 
      and not be richard that hath done all this
  
    king richard
  say that i did all this for love of her
  
    queen elizabeth
  nay
  then indeed she cannot choose but 
        hate thee
  
      having bought love with such a bloody spoil
  
    king richard
  look what is done cannot be now amended
  
      men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes
  
      which after hours gives leisure to repent
  
      if i did take the kingdom from your sons
  
      to make amends i ll give it to your daughter
  
      if i have kill d the issue of your womb
  
      to quicken your increase i will beget 
      mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
  
      a grandam s name is little less in love 
      than is the doating title of a mother
  
      they are as children but one step below
  
      even of your metal
  of your very blood
  
      of all one pain
  save for a night of groans 
      endur d of her
  for whom you bid like sorrow
  
      your children were vexation to your youth
  
      but mine shall be a comfort to your age
  
      the loss you have is but a son being king
  
      and by that loss your daughter is made queen
  
      i cannot make you what amends i would
  
      therefore accept such kindness as i can
  
      dorset your son
  that with a fearful soul 
      leads discontented steps in foreign soil
  
      this fair alliance quickly shall can home 
      to high promotions and great dignity
  
      the king
  that calls your beauteous daughter wife
  
      familiarly shall call thy dorset brother
  
      again shall you be mother to a king
  
      and all the ruins of distressful times 
      repair d with double riches of content
  
      what
  we have many goodly days to see
  
      the liquid drops of tears that you have shed 
      shall come again
  transform d to orient pearl
  
      advantaging their loan with interest 
      of ten times double gain of happiness
  
      go
  then
  my mother
  to thy daughter go
  
      make bold her bashful years with your experience
  
      prepare her ears to hear a wooer s tale
  
      put in her tender heart th  aspiring flame 
      of golden sovereignty
  acquaint the princes 
      with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
  
      and when this arm of mine hath chastised 
      the petty rebel
  dull brain d buckingham
  
      bound with triumphant garlands will i come
  
      and lead thy daughter to a conqueror s bed
  
      to whom i will retail my conquest won
  
      and she shall be sole victoress
  caesar s caesar
  
    queen elizabeth
  what were i best to say
  her father s 
        brother 
      would be her lord
  or shall i say her uncle
  
      or he that slew her brothers and her uncles
  
      under what title shall i woo for thee 
      that god
  the law
  my honour
  and her love 
      can make seem pleasing to her tender years
  
    king richard
  infer fair england s peace by this alliance
  
    queen elizabeth
  which she shall purchase with 
      still lasting war
  
    king richard
  tell her the king
  that may command
  
      entreats
  
    queen elizabeth
  that at her hands which the king s 
      king forbids
  
    king richard
  say she shall be a high and mighty queen
  
    queen elizabeth
  to wail the title
  as her mother doth
  
    king richard
  say i will love her everlastingly
  
    queen elizabeth
  but how long shall that title  ever  last
  
    king richard
  sweetly in force unto her fair life s end
  
    queen elizabeth
  but how long fairly shall her sweet life 
      last
  
    king richard
  as long as heaven and nature lengthens it
  
    queen elizabeth
  as long as hell and richard likes of it
  
    king richard
  say i
  her sovereign
  am her subject low
  
    queen elizabeth
  but she
  your subject
  loathes such 
      sovereignty
  
    king richard
  be eloquent in my behalf to her
  
    queen elizabeth
  an honest tale speeds best being plainly 
      told
  
    king richard
  then plainly to her tell my loving tale
  
    queen elizabeth
  plain and not honest is too harsh a style
  
    king richard
  your reasons are too shallow and too quick
  
    queen elizabeth
  o
  no
  my reasons are too deep and 
        dead  
      too deep and dead
  poor infants
  in their graves
  
    king richard
  harp not on that string

      if you do fight against your country s foes
  
      your country s foes shall pay your pains the hire
  
      if you do fight in safeguard of your wives
  
      your wives shall welcome home the conquerors

      your children s children quits it in your age
