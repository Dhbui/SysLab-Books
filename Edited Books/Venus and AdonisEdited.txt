               vilia miretur vulgus
  mihi flavus apollo 
              pocula castalia plena ministret aqua
   
       
   
  to the right honourable 
   
  henry wriothesley
   earl of southampton
  
   
  and baron of titchfield
   
   
   
  right honourable
  i know not how i shall offend in dedicating my 
  unpolished lines to your lordship
  nor how the world will censure me 
  for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a burthen
  only
  if 
  your honour seem but pleased
  i account myself highly praised
  and vow 
  to take advantage of all idle hours
  till i have honoured you with some 
  graver labour
  but if the first heir of my invention prove deformed
  i 
  shall be sorry it had so noble a godfather
  and never after ear so 
  barren a land
  for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest
  i leave it 
  to your honourable survey
  and your honour to your heart s content
  
  which i wish may always answer your own wish and the world s hopeful 
  expectation
  
   
   
  your honour s in all duty

   venus and adonis  
   
   
  even as the sun with purple colour d face 
  had ta en his last leave of the weeping morn
  
  rose cheek d adonis tried him to the chase
  
  hunting he lov d
  but love he laugh d to scorn
         4 
    sick thoughted venus makes amain unto him
  
    and like a bold fac d suitor  gins to woo him
  
   
   thrice fairer than myself
   thus she began
  
   the field s chief flower
  sweet above compare
         8 
  stain to all nymphs
  more lovely than a man
  
  more white and red than doves or roses are
  
    nature that made thee
  with herself at strife
  
    saith that the world hath ending with thy life
      12 
   
   vouchsafe
  thou wonder
  to alight thy steed
  
  and rein his proud head to the saddle bow
  
  if thou wilt deign this favour
  for thy meed 
  a thousand honey secrets shalt thou know
              16 
    here come and sit
  where never serpent hisses
  
    and being set
  i ll smother thee with kisses
  
   
   and yet not cloy thy lips with loath d satiety
  
  but rather famish them amid their plenty
              20 
  making them red
  and pale
  with fresh variety
  
  ten kisses short as one
  one long as twenty
  
    a summer s day will seem an hour but short
  
    being wasted in such time beguiling sport
           24 
   
  with this she seizeth on his sweating palm
  
  the precedent of pith and livelihood
  
  and trembling in her passion
  calls it balm
  
  earth s sovereign salve to do a goddess good
          28 
    being so enrag d
  desire doth lend her force 
    courageously to pluck him from his horse
  
   
  over one arm the lusty courser s rein
  
  under her other was the tender boy
                    32 
  who blush d and pouted in a dull disdain
  
  with leaden appetite
  unapt to toy
  
    she red and hot as coals of glowing fire
  
    he red for shame
  but frosty in desire
              36 
   
  the studded bridle on a ragged bough 
  nimbly she fastens
 
 o
  how quick is love
 
  
  the steed is stalled up
  and even now 
  to tie the rider she begins to prove
                  40 
    backward she push d him
  as she would be thrust
  
    and govern d him in strength
  though not in lust
  
   
  so soon was she along
  as he was down
  
  each leaning on their elbows and their hips
           44 
  now doth she stroke his cheek
  now doth he frown
  
  and  gins to chide
  but soon she stops his lips
  
    and kissing speaks
  with lustful language broken
  
     if thou wilt chide
  thy lips shall never open
      48 
   
  he burns with bashful shame
  she with her tears 
  doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks
  
  then with her windy sighs and golden hairs 
  to fan and blow them dry again she seeks
              52 
    he saith she is immodest
  blames her miss
  
    what follows more
  she murders with a kiss
  
   
  even as an empty eagle
  sharp by fast
  
  tires with her beak on feathers
  flesh and bone
       56 
  shaking her wings
  devouring all in haste
  
  till either gorge be stuff d or prey be gone
  
    even so she kiss d his brow
  his cheek
  his chin
  
    and where she ends she doth anew begin
              60 
   
  forc d to content
  but never to obey
  
  panting he lies
  and breatheth in her face
  
  she feedeth on the steam
  as on a prey
  
  and calls it heavenly moisture
  air of grace
          64 
    wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers 
    so they were dew d with such distilling showers
  
   
  look how a bird lies tangled in a net
  
  so fasten d in her arms adonis lies
                   68 
  pure shame and aw d resistance made him fret
  
  which bred more beauty in his angry eyes
  
    rain added to a river that is rank 
    perforce will force it overflow the bank
            72 
   
  still she entreats
  and prettily entreats
  
  for to a pretty ear she tunes her tale
  
  still is he sullen
  still he lours and frets
  
   twixt crimson shame and anger ashy pale
              76 
    being red she loves him best
  and being white
  
    her best is better d with a more delight
  
   
  look how he can
  she cannot choose but love
  
  and by her fair immortal hand she swears
              80 
  from his soft bosom never to remove
  
  till he take truce with her contending tears
  
    which long have rain d
  making her cheeks all wet
  
    and one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt
  
   
  upon this promise did he raise his chin
                85 
  like a dive dapper peering through a wave
  
  who
  being look d on
  ducks as quickly in
  
  so offers he to give what she did crave
                88 
    but when her lips were ready for his pay
  
    he winks
  and turns his lips another way
  
   
  never did passenger in summer s heat 
  more thirst for drink than she for this good turn
     92 
  her help she sees
  but help she cannot get
  
  she bathes in water
  yet her fire must burn
  
     o
  pity
    gan she cry
   flint hearted boy
  
     tis but a kiss i beg
  why art thou coy
             96 
   
   i have been woo d as i entreat thee now
  
  even by the stern and direful god of war
  
  whose sinewy neck in battle ne er did bow
  
  who conquers where he comes in every jar
              100 
    yet hath he been my captive and my slave
  
    and begg d for that which thou unask d shalt have
  
   
   over my altars hath he hung his lance
  
  his batter d shield
  his uncontrolled crest
           104 
  and for my sake hath learn d to sport and dance
  
  to toy
  to wanton
  dally
  smile
  and jest
  
    scorning his churlish drum and ensign red 
    making my arms his field
  his tent my bed
          108 
   
   thus he that overrul d i oversway d
  
  leading him prisoner in a red rose chain
  
  strong temper d steel his stronger strength obey d
  
  yet was he servile to my coy disdain
                 112 
    oh be not proud
  nor brag not of thy might
  
    for mast ring her that foil d the god of fight
  
   
   touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine
  
  though mine be not so fair
  yet are they red
         116 
  the kiss shall be thine own as well as mine
  
  what see st thou in the ground
  hold up thy head
  
    look in mine eyeballs
  there thy beauty lies
  
    then why not lips on lips
  since eyes in eyes
      120 
   
   art thou asham d to kiss
  then wink again
  
  and i will wink
  so shall the day seem night
  
  love keeps his revels where there are but twain
  
  be bold to play
  our sport is not in sight
           124 
    these blue vein d violets whereon we lean 
    never can blab
  nor know not what we mean
  
   
   the tender spring upon thy tempting lip             127 
  shows thee unripe
  yet mayst thou well be tasted
  
  make use of time
  let not advantage slip
  
  beauty within itself should not be wasted
  
    fair flowers that are not gather d in their prime 
    rot
  and consume themselves in little time
          132 
   
   were i hard favour d
  foul
  or wrinkled old
  
  ill nurtur d
  crooked
  churlish
  harsh in voice
  
  o erworn
  despised
  rheumatic
  and cold
  
  thick sighted
  barren
  lean
  and lacking juice
       136 
    then mightst thou pause
  for then i were not for thee
  
    but having no defects
  why dost abhor me
  
   
   thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow
            139 
  mine eyes are grey and bright
  and quick in turning
  
  my beauty as the spring doth yearly grow
  
  my flesh is soft and plump
  my marrow burning
  
    my smooth moist hand
  were it with thy hand felt
  
    would in thy palm dissolve
  or seem to melt
        144 
   
   bid me discourse
  i will enchant thine ear
  
  or like a fairy
  trip upon the green
  
  or like a nymph
  with long dishevell d hair
  
  dance on the sands
  and yet no footing seen
          148 
    love is a spirit all compact of fire
  
    not gross to sink
  but light
  and will aspire
  
   
   witness this primrose bank whereon i lie
            151 
  these forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me
  
  two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky
  
  from morn till night
  even where i list to sport me
  
    is love so light
  sweet boy
  and may it be 
    that thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee
        156 
   
   is thine own heart to thine own face affected
  
  can thy right hand seize love upon thy left
  
  then woo thyself
  be of thyself rejected
  
  steal thine own freedom
  and complain on theft
       160 
    narcissus so himself himself forsook
  
    and died to kiss his shadow in the brook
  
   
   torches are made to light
  jewels to wear
  
  dainties to taste
  fresh beauty for the use
          164 
  herbs for their smell
  and sappy plants to bear
  
  things growing to themselves are growth s abuse
  
    seeds spring from seeds
  and beauty breedeth beauty
  
    thou wast begot
  to get it is thy duty
             168 
   
   upon the earth s increase why shouldst thou feed
  
  unless the earth with thy increase be fed
  
  by law of nature thou art bound to breed
  
  that thine may live when thou thyself art dead
       172 
    and so in spite of death thou dost survive
  
    in that thy likeness still is left alive
   
   
  by this the love sick queen began to sweat
  
  for where they lay the shadow had forsook them
       176 
  and titan
  tired in the midday heat
  
  with burning eye did hotly overlook them
  
    wishing adonis had his team to guide
  
    so he were like him and by venus  side
             180 
   
  and now adonis with a lazy spright
  
  and with a heavy
  dark
  disliking eye
  
  his louring brows o erwhelming his fair sight
  
  like misty vapours when they blot the sky
            184 
    souring his cheeks
  cries
   fie
  no more of love
  
    the sun doth burn my face
  i must remove
   
   
   ay me
   quoth venus
   young
  and so unkind
  
  what bare excuses mak st thou to be gone
             188 
  i ll sigh celestial breath
  whose gentle wind 
  shall cool the heat of this descending sun
  
    i ll make a shadow for thee of my hairs
  
    if they burn too
  i ll quench them with my tears
   192 
   
   the sun that shines from heaven shines but warm
  
  and lo i lie between that sun and thee
  
  the heat i have from thence doth little harm
  
  thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me
       196 
    and were i not immortal
  life were done
  
    between this heavenly and earthly sun
  
   
   art thou obdurate
  flinty
  hard as steel
  
  nay more than flint
  for stone at rain relenteth
     200 
  art thou a woman s son and canst not feel 
  what  tis to love
  how want of love tormenteth
  
    o had thy mother borne so hard a mind
  
    she had not brought forth thee
  but died unkind
    204 
   
   what am i that thou shouldst contemn me this
  
  or what great danger dwells upon my suit
  
  what were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss
  
  speak
  fair
  but speak fair words
  or else be mute
   208 
    give me one kiss
  i ll give it thee again
  
    and one for int rest
  if thou wilt have twain
  
   
   fie
  lifeless picture
  cold and senseless stone
  
  well painted idol
  image dull and dead
               212 
  statue contenting but the eye alone
  
  thing like a man
  but of no woman bred
  
    thou art no man
  though of a man s complexion
  
    for men will kiss even by their own direction
      216 
   
  this said
  impatience chokes her pleading tongue
  
  and swelling passion doth provoke a pause
  
  red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth her wrong
  
  being judge in love
  she cannot right her cause
      220 
    and now she weeps
  and now she fain would speak
  
    and now her sobs do her intendments break
  
   
  sometimes she shakes her head
  and then his hand
  
  now gazeth she on him
  now on the ground
             224 
  sometimes her arms infold him like a band
  
  she would
  he will not in her arms be bound
  
    and when from thence he struggles to be gone
  
    she locks her lily fingers one in one
              228 
   
   fondling
   she saith
   since i have hemm d thee here 
  within the circuit of this ivory pale
  
  i ll be a park
  and thou shalt be my deer
  
  feed where thou wilt
  on mountain or in dale
         232 
    graze on my lips
  and if those hills be dry
  
    stray lower
  where the pleasant fountains lie
  
   
   within this limit is relief enough
  
  sweet bottom grass and high delightful plain
         236 
  round rising hillocks
  brakes obscure and rough
  
  to shelter thee from tempest and from rain
  
    then be my deer
  since i am such a park
            239 
    no dog shall rouse thee
  though a thousand bark
   
   
  at this adonis smiles as in disdain
  
  that in each cheek appears a pretty dimple
  
  love made those hollows
  if himself were slain
  
  he might be buried in a tomb so simple
               244 
    foreknowing well
  if there he came to lie
  
    why there love liv d
  and there he could not die
  
   
  these lovely caves
  these round enchanting pits
  
  open d their mouths to swallow venus  liking
         248 
  being mad before
  how doth she now for wits
  
  struck dead at first
  what needs a second striking
  
    poor queen of love
  in thine own law forlorn
  
    to love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn
       252 
   
  now which way shall she turn
  what shall she say
  
  her words are done
  her woes the more increasing
  
  the time is spent
  her object will away
  
  and from her twining arms doth urge releasing
        256 
     pity
   she cries
   some favour
  some remorse
   
    away he springs
  and hasteth to his horse
  
   
  but lo from forth a copse that neighbours by
  
  a breeding jennet
  lusty
  young
  and proud
           260 
  adonis  tramping courser doth espy
  
  and forth she rushes
  snorts and neighs aloud
  
    the strong neck d steed
  being tied unto a tree
  
    breaketh his rein
  and to her straight goes he
     264 
   
  imperiously he leaps
  he neighs
  he bounds
  
  and now his woven girths he breaks asunder
  
  the bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds
  
  whose hollow womb resounds like heaven s thunder
  
    the iron bit he crusheth  tween his teeth
          269 
    controlling what he was controlled with
  
   
  his ears up prick d
  his braided hanging mane 
  upon his compass d crest now stand on end
            272 
  his nostrils drink the air
  and forth again
  
  as from a furnace
  vapours doth he send
  
    his eye
  which scornfully glisters like fire
  
    shows his hot courage and his high desire
          276 
   
  sometime he trots
  as if he told the steps
  
  with gentle majesty and modest pride
  
  anon he rears upright
  curvets and leaps
  
  as who should say
   lo thus my strength is tried
  
    and this i do to captivate the eye                 281 
    of the fair breeder that is standing by
   
   
  what recketh he his rider s angry stir
  
  his flattering  holla 
  or his  stand
  i say 
        284 
  what cares he now for curb or pricking spur
  
  for rich caparisons or trappings gay
  
    he sees his love
  and nothing else he sees
  
    nor nothing else with his proud sight agrees
       288 
   
  look when a painter would surpass the life
  
  in limning out a well proportion d steed
  
  his art with nature s workmanship at strife
  
  as if the dead the living should exceed
              292 
    so did this horse excel a common one
  
    in shape
  in courage
  colour
  pace and bone
  
   
  round hoof d
  short jointed
  fetlocks shag and long
  
  broad breast
  full eye
  small head
  and nostril wide
  
  high crest
  short ears
  straight legs and passing strong
  
  thin mane
  thick tail
  broad buttock
  tender hide
  
    look
  what a horse should have he did not lack
  
    save a proud rider on so proud a back
              300 
   
  sometimes he scuds far off
  and there he stares
  
  anon he starts at stirring of a feather
  
  to bid the wind a base he now prepares
  
  and where he run or fly they know not whether
        304 
    for through his mane and tail the high wind sings
  
    fanning the hairs
  who wave like feather d wings
  
   
  he looks upon his love
  and neighs unto her
  
  she answers him as if she knew his mind
              308 
  being proud
  as females are
  to see him woo her
  
  she puts on outward strangeness
  seems unkind
  
    spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels
  
    beating his kind embracements with her heels
       312 
   
  then like a melancholy malcontent
  
  he vails his tail that like a falling plume
  
  cool shadow to his melting buttock lent
  
  he stamps
  and bites the poor flies in his fume
      316 
    his love
  perceiving how he was enrag d
  
    grew kinder
  and his fury was assuag d
  
   
  his testy master goeth about to take him
  
  when lo the unback d breeder
  full of fear
          320 
  jealous of catching
  swiftly doth forsake him
  
  with her the horse
  and left adonis there
  
    as they were mad
  unto the wood they hie them
  
    outstripping crows that strive to overfly them
     324 
   
  all swoln with chafing
  down adonis sits
  
  banning his boisterous and unruly beast
  
  and now the happy season once more fits 
  that love sick love by pleading may be blest
         328 
    for lovers say
  the heart hath treble wrong
  
    when it is barr d the aidance of the tongue
  
   
  an oven that is stopp d
  or river stay d
  
  burneth more hotly
  swelleth with more rage
          332 
  so of concealed sorrow may be said
  
  free vent of words love s fire doth assuage
  
    but when the heart s attorney once is mute
  
    the client breaks
  as desperate in his suit
        336 
   
  he sees her coming
  and begins to glow
  
  even as a dying coal revives with wind
  
  and with his bonnet hides his angry brow
  
  looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind
          340 
    taking no notice that she is so nigh
  
    for all askance he holds her in his eye
  
   
  o what a sight it was
  wistly to view 
  how she came stealing to the wayward boy
             344 
  to note the fighting conflict of her hue
  
  how white and red each other did destroy
  
    but now her cheek was pale
  and by and by 
    it flash d forth fire
  as lightning from the sky
   348 
   
  now was she just before him as he sat
  
  and like a lowly lover down she kneels
  
  with one fair hand she heaveth up his hat
  
  her other tender hand his fair cheek feels
           352 
    his tend rer cheek receives her soft hand s print
  
    as apt as new fall n snow takes any dint
  
   
  oh what a war of looks was then between them
  
  her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing
               356 
  his eyes saw her eyes
  as they had not seen them
  
  her eyes woo d still
  his eyes disdain d the wooing
  
    and all this dumb play had his acts made plain 
    with tears
  which
  chorus like
  her eyes did rain
  
   
  full gently now she takes him by the hand
            361 
  a lily prison d in a gaol of snow
  
  or ivory in an alabaster band
  
  so white a friend engirts so white a foe
             364 
    this beauteous combat
  wilful and unwilling
  
    show d like two silver doves that sit a billing
  
   
  once more the engine of her thoughts began
  
   o fairest mover on this mortal round
                368 
  would thou wert as i am
  and i a man
  
  my heart all whole as thine
  thy heart my wound
  
    for one sweet look thy help i would assure thee
  
    though nothing but my body s bane would cure thee
   
   
   give me my hand
   saith he
   why dost thou feel it
   
   give me my heart
   saith she
   and thou shalt have it
  
  o give it me lest thy hard heart do steel it
  
  and being steel d
  soft sighs can never grave it
     376 
    then love s deep groans i never shall regard
  
    because adonis  heart hath made mine hard
   
   
   for shame
   he cries
   let go
  and let me go
  
  my day s delight is past
  my horse is gone
           380 
  and  tis your fault i am bereft him so
  
  i pray you hence
  and leave me here alone
  
    for all my mind
  my thought
  my busy care
  
    is how to get my palfrey from the mare
             384 
   
  thus she replies
   thy palfrey as he should
  
  welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire
  
  affection is a coal that must be cool d
  
  else
  suffer d
  it will set the heart on fire
        388 
    the sea hath bounds
  but deep desire hath none
  
    therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone
  
   
   how like a jade he stood tied to the tree
  
  servilely master d with a leathern rein
              392 
  but when he saw his love
  his youth s fair fee
  
  he held such petty bondage in disdain
  
    throwing the base thong from his bending crest
  
    enfranchising his mouth
  his back
  his breast
      396 
   
   who sees his true love in her naked bed
  
  teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white
  
  but when his glutton eye so full hath fed
  
  his other agents aim at like delight
                 400 
    who is so faint that dare not be so bold 
    to touch the fire
  the weather being cold
  
   
   let me excuse thy courser
  gentle boy
  
  and learn of him
  i heartily beseech thee
            404 
  to take advantage on presented joy
  
  though i were dumb
  yet his proceedings teach thee
  
    o learn to love
  the lesson is but plain
  
    and once made perfect
  never lost again
            408 
   
   i know not love
   quoth he
   nor will not know it
  
  unless it be a boar
  and then i chase it
  
   tis much to borrow
  and i will not owe it
  
  my love to love is love but to disgrace it
           412 
    for i have heard
  it is a life in death
  
    that laughs and weeps
  and all but with a breath
  
   
   who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish d
  
  who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth
         416 
  if springing things be any jot diminish d
  
  they wither in their prime
  prove nothing worth
  
    the colt that s back d and burden d being young
  
    loseth his pride
  and never waxeth strong
          420 
   
   you hurt my hand with wringing
  let us part
  
  and leave this idle theme
  this bootless chat
  
  remove your siege from my unyielding heart
  
  to love s alarms it will not ope the gate
            424 
    dismiss your vows
  your feigned tears
  your flatt ry
  
    for where a heart is hard they make no batt ry
   
   
   what
  canst thou talk
   quoth she
   hast thou a tongue
  
  o would thou hadst not
  or i had no hearing
         428 
  thy mermaid s voice hath done me double wrong
  
  i had my load before
  now press d with bearing
  
    melodious discord
  heavenly tune
  harsh sounding
  
    ear s deep sweet music
  and heart s deep sore wounding
  
   
   had i no eyes but ears
  my ears would love          433 
  that inward beauty and invisible
  
  or were i deaf
  thy outward parts would move 
  each part in me that were but sensible
               436 
    though neither eyes nor ears
  to hear nor see
  
    yet should i be in love by touching thee
  
   
   say that the sense of feeling were bereft me
  
  and that i could not see
  nor hear
  nor touch
        440 
  and nothing but the very smell were left me
  
  yet would my love to thee be still as much
  
    for from the stillitory of thy face excelling 
    comes breath perfum d
  that breedeth love by smelling
  
   
   but oh what banquet wert thou to the taste
          445 
  being nurse and feeder of the other four
  
  would they not wish the feast might ever last
  
  and bid suspicion double lock the door
  
    lest jealousy
  that sour unwelcome guest
  
    should by his stealing in disturb the feast
        448 
   
  once more the ruby colour d portal open d
  
  which to his speech did honey passage yield
          452 
  like a red morn that ever yet betoken d 
  wrack to the seaman
  tempest to the field
  
    sorrow to shepherds
  woe unto the birds
  
    gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds
       456 
   
  this ill presage advisedly she marketh
  
  even as the wind is hush d before it raineth
  
  or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh
  
  or as the berry breaks before it staineth
            460 
    or like the deadly bullet of a gun
  
    his meaning struck her ere his words begun
  
   
  and at his look she flatly falleth down 
  for looks kill love
  and love by looks reviveth
      464 
  a smile recures the wounding of a frown
  
  but blessed bankrout
  that by love so thriveth
  
    the silly boy
  believing she is dead
  
    claps her pale cheek
  till clapping makes it red
   468 
   
  and all amaz d brake off his late intent
  
  for sharply he did think to reprehend her
  
  which cunning love did wittily prevent
  
  fair fall the wit that can so well defend her
        472 
    for on the grass she lies as she were slain
  
    till his breath breatheth life in her again
  
   
  he wrings her nose
  he strikes her on the cheeks
  
  he bends her fingers
  holds her pulses hard
          476 
  he chafes her lips
  a thousand ways he seeks 
  to mend the hurt that his unkindness marr d
  
    he kisses her
  and she
  by her good will
  
    will never rise
  so he will kiss her still
         480 
   
  the night of sorrow now is turn d to day
  
  her two blue windows faintly she up heaveth
  
  like the fair sun when in his fresh array 
  he cheers the morn
  and all the world relieveth
      484 
    and as the bright sun glorifies the sky
  
    so is her face illumin d with her eye
  
   
  whose beams upon his hairless face are fix d
  
  as if from thence they borrow d all their shine
      488 
  were never four such lamps together mix d
  
  had not his clouded with his brow s repine
  
    but hers
  which through the crystal tears gave light 
    shone like the moon in water seen by night
         492 
   
   o where am i
   quoth she
   in earth or heaven
  
  or in the ocean drench d
  or in the fire
  
  what hour is this
  or morn or weary even
  
  do i delight to die
  or life desire
                  496 
    but now i liv d
  and life was death s annoy
  
    but now i died
  and death was lively joy
  
   
   o thou didst kill me
  kill me once again
  
  thy eyes  shrewd tutor
  that hard heart of thine
     500 
  hath taught them scornful tricks
  and such disdain
  
  that they have murder d this poor heart of mine
  
    and these mine eyes
  true leaders to their queen
  
    but for thy piteous lips no more had seen
          504 
   
   long may they kiss each other for this cure
  
  oh never let their crimson liveries wear
  
  and as they last
  their verdure still endure
  
  to drive infection from the dangerous year
           508 
    that the star gazers
  having writ on death
  
    may say
  the plague is banish d by thy breath
  
   
   pure lips
  sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted
  
  what bargains may i make
  still to be sealing
        512 
  to sell myself i can be well contented
  
  so thou wilt buy
  and pay
  and use good dealing
  
    which purchase if thou make
  for fear of slips
  
    set thy seal manual on my wax red lips
             516 
   
   a thousand kisses buys my heart from me
  
  and pay them at thy leisure
  one by one
  
  what is ten hundred touches unto thee
  
  are they not quickly told and quickly gone
           520 
    say
  for non payment that the debt should double
  
    is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble
   
   
   fair queen
   quoth he
   if any love you owe me
  
  measure my strangeness with my unripe years
          524 
  before i know myself
  seek not to know me
  
  no fisher but the ungrown fry forbears
  
    the mellow plum doth fall
  the green sticks fast
  
    or being early pluck d
  is sour to taste
           528 
   
   look the world s comforter
  with weary gait 
  his day s hot task hath ended in the west
  
  the owl
  night s herald
  shrieks
   tis very late
  
  the sheep are gone to fold
  birds to their nest
      532 
    and coal black clouds that shadow heaven s light 
    do summon us to part
  and bid good night
  
   
   now let me say good night
  and so say you
  
  if you will say so
  you shall have a kiss
            536 
   good night
   quoth she
  and ere he says adieu
  
  the honey fee of parting tender d is
  
    her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace
  
    incorporate then they seem
  face grows to face
     540 
   
  till breathless he disjoin d
  and backward drew 
  the heavenly moisture
  that sweet coral mouth
  
  whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew
  
  whereon they surfeit
  yet complain on drouth
         544 
    he with her plenty press d
  she faint with dearth
  
    their lips together glued
  fall to the earth
  
   
  now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey
  
  and glutton like she feeds
  yet never filleth
        548 
  her lips are conquerors
  his lips obey
  
  paying what ransom the insulter willeth
  
    whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high
  
    that she will draw his lips  rich treasure dry
     552 
   
  and having felt the sweetness of the spoil
  
  with blindfold fury she begins to forage
  
  her face doth reek and smoke
  her blood doth boil
  
  and careless lust stirs up a desperate courage
       556 
    planting oblivion
  beating reason back
  
    forgetting shame s pure blush and honour s wrack
  
   
  hot
  faint
  and weary
  with her hard embracing
  
  like a wild bird being tam d with too much handling
  
  or as the fleet foot roe that s tir d with chasing
   561 
  or like the froward infant still d with dandling
  
    he now obeys
  and now no more resisteth
  
    while she takes all she can
  not all she listeth
   564 
   
  what wax so frozen but dissolves with temp ring
  
  and yields at last to every light impression
  
  things out of hope are compass d oft with vent ring
  
  chiefly in love
  whose leave exceeds commission
      568 
    affection faints not like a pale fac d coward
  
    but then woos best when most his choice is froward
  
   
  when he did frown
  o had she then gave over
  
  such nectar from his lips she had not suck d
         572 
  foul words and frowns must not repel a lover
  
  what though the rose have prickles
  yet  tis pluck d
  
    were beauty under twenty locks kept fast
  
    yet love breaks through
  and picks them all at last
  
   
  for pity now she can no more detain him
              577 
  the poor fool prays her that he may depart
  
  she is resolv d no longer to restrain him
  
  bids him farewell
  and look well to her heart
        580 
    the which by cupid s bow she doth protest
  
    he carries thence encaged in his breast
  
   
   sweet boy
   she says
   this night i ll waste in sorrow
  
  for my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch
        584 
  tell me
  love s master
  shall we meet tomorrow 
  say
  shall we
  shall we
  wilt thou make the match
   
    he tells her no
  tomorrow he intends 
    to hunt the boar with certain of his friends
       588 
   
   the boar
   quoth she
  whereat a sudden pale
  
  like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose
  
  usurps her cheek
  she trembles at his tale
  
  and on his neck her yoking arms she throws
           592 
    she sinketh down
  still hanging by his neck
  
    he on her belly falls
  she on her back
  
   
  now is she in the very lists of love
  
  her champion mounted for the hot encounter
           596 
  all is imaginary she doth prove
  
  he will not manage her
  although he mount her
  
    that worse than tantalus  is her annoy
  
    to clip elysium and to lack her joy
                600 
   
  even as poor birds
  deceiv d with painted grapes
  
  do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw
  
  even so she languisheth in her mishaps
  
  as those poor birds that helpless berries saw
        604 
    the warm effects which she in him finds missing
  
    she seeks to kindle with continual kissing
  
   
  but all in vain
  good queen
  it will not be
  
  she hath assay d as much as may be prov d
            608 
  her pleading hath deserv d a greater fee
  
  she s love
  she loves
  and yet she is not lov d
  
     fie
  fie
   he says
   you crush me
  let me go
  
    you have no reason to withhold me so
               612 
   
   thou hadst been gone
   quoth she
   sweet boy
  ere this
  
  but that thou told st me thou wouldst hunt the boar
  
  oh be advis d
  thou know st not what it is
  
  with javelin s point a churlish swine to gore
        616 
    whose tushes never sheath d he whetteth still
  
    like to a mortal butcher
  bent to kill
  
   
   on his bow back he hath a battle set 
  of bristly pikes
  that ever threat his foes
          620 
  his eyes like glow worms shine when he doth fret
  
  his snout digs sepulchres where er he goes
  
    being mov d
  he strikes whate er is in his way
  
    and whom he strikes his crooked tushes slay
        624 
   
   his brawny sides
  with hairy bristles armed
  
  are better proof than thy spear s point can enter
  
  his short thick neck cannot be easily harmed
  
  being ireful
  on the lion he will venture
            628 
    the thorny brambles and embracing bushes
  
    as fearful of him
  part
  through whom he rushes
  
   
   alas
  he naught esteems that face of thine
  
  to which love s eyes pay tributary gazes
             632 
  nor thy soft hands
  sweet lips
  and crystal eyne
  
  whose full perfection all the world amazes
  
    but having thee at vantage
  wondrous dread
  
    would root these beauties as he roots the mead
  
   
   oh let him keep his loathsome cabin still
           637 
  beauty hath naught to do with such foul fiends
  
  come not within his danger by thy will
  
  they that thrive well
  take counsel of their friends
  
    when thou didst name the boar
  not to dissemble
  
    i fear d thy fortune
  and my joints did tremble
  
   
   didst thou not mark my face
  was it not white
  
  saw st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye
       644 
  grew i not faint
  and fell i not downright
  
  within my bosom
  whereon thou dost lie
  
    my boding heart pants
  beats
  and takes no rest
  
    but like an earthquake
  shakes thee on my breast
  
   
   for where love reigns
  disturbing jealousy          649 
  doth call himself affection s sentinel
  
  gives false alarms
  suggesteth mutiny
  
  and in a peaceful hour doth cry  kill
  kill
          652 
    distemp ring gentle love in his desire
  
    as air and water do abate the fire
  
   
   this sour informer
  this bate breeding spy
  
  this canker that eats up love s tender spring
        656 
  this carry tale
  dissentious jealousy
  
  that sometime true news
  sometime false doth bring
  
    knocks at my heart
  and whispers in mine ear
  
    that if i love thee
  i thy death should fear
       660 
   
   and more than so
  presenteth to mine eye 
  the picture of an angry chafing boar
  
  under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie 
  an image like thyself
  all stain d with gore
         664 
    whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
  
    doth make them droop with grief and hang the head
  
   
   what should i do
  seeing thee so indeed
  
  that tremble at th imagination
                       668 
  the thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed
  
  and fear doth teach it divination
  
    i prophesy thy death
  my living sorrow
  
    if thou encounter with the boar tomorrow
           672 
   
   but if thou needs wilt hunt
  be rul d by me
  
  uncouple at the timorous flying hare
  
  or at the fox which lives by subtilty
  
  or at the roe which no encounter dare
                676 
    pursue these fearful creatures o er the downs
  
    and on thy well breath d horse keep with thy hounds
  
   
   and when thou hast on foot the purblind hare
  
  mark the poor wretch
  to overshoot his troubles      680 
  how he outruns the wind
  and with what care 
  he cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles
  
    the many musits through the which he goes 
    are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes
             684 
   
   sometime he runs among a flock of sheep
  
  to make the cunning hounds mistake their smell
  
  and sometime where earth delving conies keep
  
  to stop the loud pursuers in their yell
              688 
    and sometime sorteth with a herd of deer
  
    danger deviseth shifts
  wit waits on fear
  
   
   for there his smell with others being mingled
       691 
  the hot scent snuffing hounds are driven to doubt
  
  ceasing their clamorous cry
  till they have singled 
  with much ado the cold fault cleanly out
  
    then do they spend their mouths
  echo replies
  
    as if another chase were in the skies
              696 
   
   by this
  poor wat
  far off upon a hill
  
  stands on his hinder legs with list ning ear
  
  to hearken if his foes pursue him still
  
  anon their loud alarums he doth hear
                 700 
    and now his grief may be compared well 
    to one sore sick that hears the passing bell
  
   
   then shalt thou see the dew bedabbled wretch 
  turn
  and return
  indenting with the way
             704 
  each envious briar his weary legs do scratch
  
  each shadow makes him stop
  each murmur stay
  
    for misery is trodden on by many
  
    and being low never reliev d by any
                708 
   
   lie quietly
  and hear a little more
  
  nay
  do not struggle
  for thou shalt not rise
  
  to make thee hate the hunting of the boar
  
  unlike myself thou hear st me moralize
               712 
    applying this to that
  and so to so
  
    for love can comment upon every woe
  
   
   where did i leave
    no matter where
   quoth he 
   leave me
  and then the story aptly ends
             716 
  the night is spent
    why
  what of that
   quoth she
  
   i am
   quoth he
   expected of my friends
  
    and now  tis dark
  and going i shall fall
   
     in night
   quoth she
   desire sees best of all
    720 
   
  but if thou fall
  oh then imagine this
  
  the earth
  in love with thee
  thy footing trips
  
  and all is but to rob thee of a kiss
                 723 
  rich preys make true men thieves
  so do thy lips 
    make modest dian cloudy and forlorn
  
    lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn
  
   
   now of this dark night i perceive the reason
  
  cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine          728 
  till forging nature be condemn d of treason
  
  for stealing moulds from heaven
  that were divine
  
    wherein she fram d thee
  in high heaven s despite
  
    to shame the sun by day and her by night
           732 
   
   and therefore hath she brib d the destinies
  
  to cross the curious workmanship of nature
  
  to mingle beauty with infirmities
  
  and pure perfection with impure defeature
            736 
    making it subject to the tyranny 
    of mad mischances and much misery
  
   
   as burning fevers
  agues pale and faint
  
  life poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood
          740 
  the marrow eating sickness
  whose attaint 
  disorder breeds by heating of the blood
  
    surfeits
  imposthumes
  grief
  and damn d despair
  
    swear nature s death
  for framing thee so fair
     744 
   
   and not the least of all these maladies 
  but in one minute s fight brings beauty under
  
  both favour
  savour
  hue and qualities
  
  whereat th impartial gazer late did wonder
           748 
    are on the sudden wasted
  thaw d and done
  
    as mountain snow melts with the midday sun
  
   
   therefore despite of fruitless chastity
  
  love lacking vestals and self loving nuns
            752 
  that on the earth would breed a scarcity 
  and barren dearth of daughters and of sons
  
    be prodigal
  the lamp that burns by night 
    dries up his oil to lend the world his light
       756 
   
   what is thy body but a swallowing grave
  
  seeming to bury that posterity
  
  which by the rights of time thou needs must have
  
  if thou destroy them not in dark obscurity
           760 
    if so
  the world will hold thee in disdain
  
    sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain
  
   
   so in thyself thyself art made away
  
  a mischief worse than civil home bred strife
         764 
  or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay
  
  or butcher sire that reeves his son of life
  
    foul cank ring rust the hidden treasure frets
  
    but gold that s put to use more gold begets
        768 
   
   nay then
   quoth adon
   you will fall again 
  into your idle over handled theme
  
  the kiss i gave you is bestow d in vain
  
  and all in vain you strive against the stream
        772 
    for by this black fac d night
  desire s foul nurse
  
    your treatise makes me like you worse and worse
  
   
   if love have lent you twenty thousand tongues
  
  and every tongue more moving than your own
           776 
  bewitching like the wanton mermaid s songs
  
  yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
  
    for know
  my heart stands armed in mine ear
  
    and will not let a false sound enter there
         780 
   
   lest the deceiving harmony should run 
  into the quiet closure of my breast
  
  and then my little heart were quite undone
  
  in his bedchamber to be barr d of rest
               784 
    no
  lady
  no
  my heart longs not to groan
  
    but soundly sleeps
  while now it sleeps alone
  
   
   what have you urg d that i cannot reprove
  
  the path is smooth that leadeth on to danger
         790 
  i hate not love
  but your device in love 
  that lends embracements unto every stranger
  
    you do it for increase
  o strange excuse
  
    when reason is the bawd to lust s abuse
            792 
   
   call it not
  love
  for love to heaven is fled
  
  since sweating lust on earth usurp d his name
  
  under whose simple semblance he hath fed 
  upon fresh beauty
  blotting it with blame
            796 
    which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves
  
    as caterpillars do the tender leaves
  
   
   love comforteth like sunshine after rain
  
  but lust s effect is tempest after sun
               800 
  love s gentle spring doth always fresh remain
  
  lust s winter comes ere summer half be done
  
    love surfeits not
  lust like a glutton dies
  
    love is all truth
  lust full of forged lies
        804 
   
   more i could tell
  but more i dare not say
  
  the text is old
  the orator too green
  
  therefore
  in sadness
  now i will away
  
  my face is full of shame
  my heart of teen
           808 
    mine ears
  that to your wanton talk attended 
    do burn themselves for having so offended
   
   
  with this he breaketh from the sweet embrace         811 
  of those fair arms which bound him to her breast
  
  and homeward through the dark laund runs apace
  
  leaves love upon her back deeply distress d
  
    look how a bright star shooteth from the sky
  
    so glides he in the night from venus  eye
          816 
   
  which after him she darts
  as one on shore 
  gazing upon a late embarked friend
  
  till the wild waves will have him seen no more
  
  whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend
         820 
    so did the merciless and pitchy night 
    fold in the object that did feed her sight
  
   
  whereat amaz d
  as one that unaware 
  hath dropp d a precious jewel in the flood
           824 
  or  stonish d as night wanderers often are
  
  their light blown out in some mistrustful wood
  
    even so confounded in the dark she lay
  
    having lost the fair discovery of her way
          828 
   
  and now she beats her heart
  whereat it groans
  
  that all the neighbour caves
  as seeming troubled
  
  make verbal repetition of her moans
  
  passion on passion deeply is redoubled
               832 
     ay me
   she cries
  and twenty times
   woe
  woe
   
    and twenty echoes twenty times cry so
  
   
  she marking them
  begins a wailing note
  
  and sings extemporally a woeful ditty
                836 
  how love makes young men thrall
  and old men dote
  
  how love is wise in folly foolish witty
  
    her heavy anthem still concludes in woe
  
    and still the choir of echoes answer so
            840 
   
  her song was tedious
  and outwore the night
  
  for lovers  hours are long
  though seeming short
  
  if pleas d themselves
  others they think
  delight 
  in such like circumstance
  with such like sport
      844 
    their copious stories oftentimes begun
  
    end without audience
  and are never done
  
   
  for who hath she to spend the night withal
  
  but idle sounds resembling parasites
                 848 
  like shrill tongu d tapsters answering every call
  
  soothing the humour of fantastic wits
  
    she says
    tis so
   they answer all
    tis so
   
    and would say after her
  if she said  no
           852 
   
  lo here the gentle lark
  weary of rest
  
  from his moist cabinet mounts up on high
  
  and wakes the morning
  from whose silver breast 
  the sun ariseth in his majesty
                       856 
    who doth the world so gloriously behold
  
    that cedar tops and hills seem burnish d gold
  
   
  venus salutes him with this fair good morrow
  
   oh thou clear god
  and patron of all light
          860 
  from whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow 
  the beauteous influence that makes him bright
  
    there lives a son that suck d an earthly mother
  
    may lend thee light
  as thou dost lend to other
   
   
  this said
  she hasteth to a myrtle grove
             865 
  musing the morning is so much o erworn
  
  and yet she hears no tidings of her love
  
  she hearkens for his hounds and for his horn
         868 
    anon she hears them chant it lustily
  
    and all in haste she coasteth to the cry
  
   
  and as she runs
  the bushes in the way 
  some catch her by the neck
  some kiss her face
       872 
  some twine about her thigh to make her stay
  
  she wildly breaketh from their strict embrace
  
    like a milch doe
  whose swelling dugs do ache
  
    hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake
         876 
   
  by this she hears the hounds are at a bay
  
  whereat she starts like one that spies an adder 
  wreath d up in fatal folds just in his way
  
  the fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder
     880 
    even so the timorous yelping of the hounds 
    appals her senses
  and her spirit confounds
  
   
  for now she knows it is no gentle chase
  
  but the blunt boar
  rough bear
  or lion proud
        884 
  because the cry remaineth in one place
  
  where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud
  
    finding their enemy to be so curst
  
    they all strain court sy who shall cope him first
  888 
   
  this dismal cry rings sadly in her ear
  
  through which it enters to surprise her heart
  
  who overcome by doubt and bloodless fear
  
  with cold pale weakness numbs each feeling part
      892 
    like soldiers when their captain once doth yield
  
    they basely fly and dare not stay the field
  
   
  thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy
  
  till cheering up her senses sore dismay d
            896 
  she tells them  tis a causeless fantasy
  
  and childish error
  that they are afraid
  
    bids them leave quaking
  bids them fear no more
  
    and with that word
  she spied the hunted boar
      900 
   
  whose frothy mouth bepainted all with red
  
  like milk and blood being mingled both together
  
  a second fear through all her sinews spread
  
  which madly hurries her she knows not whither
        904 
    this way she runs
  and now she will no further
  
    but back retires
  to rate the boar for murther
  
   
  a thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways
  
  she treads the path that she untreads again
          908 
  her more than haste is mated with delays
  
  like the proceedings of a drunken brain
  
    full of respects
  yet naught at all respecting
  
    in hand with all things
  naught at all effecting
  
   
  here kennel d in a brake she finds a hound
           913 
  and asks the weary caitiff for his master
  
  and there another licking of his wound
  
   gainst venom d sores the only sovereign plaster
     916 
    and here she meets another sadly scowling
  
    to whom she speaks
  and he replies with howling
  
   
  when he hath ceas d his ill resounding noise
  
  another flap mouth d mourner
  black and grim
         920 
  against the welkin volleys out his voice
  
  another and another answer him
  
    clapping their proud tails to the ground below
  
    shaking their scratch d ears
  bleeding as they go
  
   
  look how the world s poor people are amazed          925 
  at apparitions
  signs
  and prodigies
  
  whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed
  
  infusing them with dreadful prophecies
               928 
    so she at these sad sighs draws up her breath
  
    and sighing it again
  exclaims on death
  
   
   hard favour d tyrant
  ugly
  meagre
  lean
            931 
  hateful divorce of love
   thus chides she death
  
   grim grinning ghost
  earth s worm
  what dost thou mean
  
  to stifle beauty and to steal his breath
  
    who when he liv d
  his breath and beauty set 
    gloss on the rose
  smell to the violet
             936 
   
   if he be dead
  o no
  it cannot be
  
  seeing his beauty
  thou shouldst strike at it
  
  o yes
  it may
  thou hast no eyes to see
  
  but hatefully at random dost thou hit
                940 
    thy mark is feeble age
  but thy false dart 
    mistakes that aim
  and cleaves an infant s heart
  
   
   hadst thou but bid beware
  then he had spoke
  
  and hearing him
  thy power had lost his power
        944 
  the destinies will curse thee for this stroke
  
  they bid thee crop a weed
  thou pluck st a flower
  
    love s golden arrow at him should have fled
  
    and not death s ebon dart to strike him dead
       948 
   
   dost thou drink tears
  that thou provok st such weeping
  
  what may a heavy groan advantage thee
  
  why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping 
  those eyes that taught all other eyes to see
         952 
    now nature cares not for thy mortal vigour
  
    since her best work is ruin d with thy rigour
   
   
  here overcome
  as one full of despair
  
  she vail d her eyelids
  who like sluices stopp d     956 
  the crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair 
  in the sweet channel of her bosom dropp d 
    but through the flood gates breaks the silver rain
  
    and with his strong course opens them again
        960 
   
  o how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow
  
  her eyes seen in the tears
  tears in her eye
  
  both crystals
  where they view d each other s sorrow
  
  sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry
       964 
    but like a stormy day
  now wind
  now rain
  
    sighs dry her cheeks
  tears make them wet again
  
   
  variable passions throng her constant woe
  
  as striving who should best become her grief
         968 
  all entertain d
  each passion labours so
  
  that every present sorrow seemeth chief
  
    but none is best
  then join they all together
  
    like many clouds consulting for foul weather
       972 
   
  by this
  far off she hears some huntsman holla
  
  a nurse s song ne er pleas d her babe so well
  
  the dire imagination she did follow 
  this sound of hope doth labour to expel
              976 
    for now reviving joy bids her rejoice
  
    and flatters her it is adonis  voice
  
   
  whereat her tears began to turn their tide
  
  being prison d in her eye
  like pearls in glass
      980 
  yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside
  
  which her cheek melts
  as scorning it should pass 
    to wash the foul face of the sluttish ground
  
    who is but drunken when she seemeth drown d
  
   
  o hard believing love
  how strange it seems          985 
  not to believe
  and yet too credulous
  
  thy weal and woe are both of them extremes
  
  despair and hope make thee ridiculous
                988 
    the one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely
  
    in likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly
  
   
  now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought
  
  adonis lives
  and death is not to blame
              992 
  it was not she that call d him all to naught
  
  now she adds honours to his hateful name
  
    she clepes him king of graves
  and grave for kings
  
    imperious supreme of all mortal things
             996 
   
   no
  no
   quoth she
   sweet death
  i did but jest
  
  yet pardon me
  i felt a kind of fear 
  whenas i met the boar
  that bloody beast
  
  which knows no pity
  but is still severe
            1000 
    then
  gentle shadow
 
 truth i must confess
  
    i rail d on thee
  fearing my love s decease
  
   
    tis not my fault
  the boar provok d my tongue
  
  be wreak d on him
  invisible commander
              1004 
   tis he
  foul creature
  that hath done thee wrong
  
  i did but act
  he s author of my slander
  
    grief hath two tongues
  and never woman yet
  
    could rule them both
  without ten women s wit
   
   
  thus hoping that adonis is alive
                    1009 
  her rash suspect she doth extenuate
  
  and that his beauty may the better thrive
  
  with death she humbly doth insinuate
                1012 
    tells him of trophies
  statues
  tombs and stories 
    his victories
  his triumphs and his glories
  
   
   o love
   quoth she
   how much a fool was i
  
  to be of such a weak and silly mind
                 1016 
  to wail his death who lives
  and must not die 
  till mutual overthrow of mortal kind
  
    for he being dead
  with him is beauty slain
  
    and beauty dead
  black chaos comes again
          1020 
   
   fie
  fie
  fond love
  thou art as full of fear 
  as one with treasure laden
  hemm d with thieves
  
  trifles unwitnessed with eye or ear
  
  thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves
      1024 
    even at this word she hears a merry horn
  
    whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn
  
   
  as falcon to the lure
  away she flies
  
  the grass stoops not
  she treads on it so light
     1028 
  and in her haste unfortunately spies 
  the foul boar s conquest on her fair delight
  
    which seen
  her eyes
  as murder d with the view
  
    like stars asham d of day
  themselves withdrew
  
   
  or as the snail
  whose tender horns being hit
       1033 
  shrinks backwards in his shelly cave with pain
  
  and there all smother d up
  in shade doth sit
  
  long after fearing to creep forth again
             1036 
    so at his bloody view her eyes are fled 
    into the deep dark cabins of her head
  
   
  where they resign their office and their light 
  to the disposing of her troubled brain
              1040 
  who bids them still consort with ugly night
  
  and never wound the heart with looks again
  
    who like a king perplexed in his throne
  
    by their suggestion gives a deadly groan
          1044 
   
  whereat each tributary subject quakes
  
  as when the wind imprison d in the ground
  
  struggling for passage
  earth s foundation shakes
  
  which with cold terror doth men s minds confound
  
    this mutiny each part doth so surprise            1049 
    that from their dark beds once more leap her eyes
  
   
  and being open d
  threw unwilling light 
  upon the wide wound that the boar had trench d 
  in his soft flank
  whose wonted lily white          1053 
  with purple tears that his wound wept
  was drench d
  
    no flower was nigh
  no grass
  herb
  leaf or weed
  
    but stole his blood and seem d with him to bleed
  
   
  this solemn sympathy poor venus noteth
              1057 
  over one shoulder doth she hang her head
  
  dumbly she passions
  franticly she doteth
  
  she thinks he could not die
  he is not dead
         1060 
    her voice is stopp d
  her joints forget to bow
  
    her eyes are mad
  that they have wept till now
  
   
  upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly
  
  that her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three
  
  and then she reprehends her mangling eye
            1065 
  that makes more gashes
  where no breach should be
  
    his face seems twain
  each several limb is doubled
  
    for oft the eye mistakes
  the brain being troubled
  
   
   my tongue cannot express my grief for one
          1069 
  and yet
   quoth she
   behold two adons dead
  
  my sighs are blown away
  my salt tears gone
  
  mine eyes are turn d to fire
  my heart to lead
      1072 
    heavy heart s lead
  melt at mine eyes  red fire
  
    so shall i die by drops of hot desire
  
   
   alas poor world
  what treasure hast thou lost
  
  what face remains alive that s worth the viewing
  
  whose tongue is music now
  what canst thou boast 
  of things long since
  or anything ensuing
           1078 
    the flowers are sweet
  their colours fresh and trim
  
    but true sweet beauty liv d and died with him
  
   
   bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear
        1081 
  nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you
  
  having no fair to lose
  you need not fear
  
  the sun doth scorn you
  and the wind doth hiss you
  
    but when adonis liv d
  sun and sharp air          1085 
    lurk d like two thieves
  to rob him of his fair
  
   
   and therefore would he put his bonnet on
  
  under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep
           1088 
  the wind would blow it off
  and being gone
  
  play with his locks
  then would adonis weep
  
    and straight
  in pity of his tender years
  
    they both would strive who first should dry his tears
  
   
   to see his face the lion walk d along              1093 
  behind some hedge
  because he would not fear him
  
  to recreate himself when he hath sung
  
  the tiger would be tame and gently hear him
         1096 
    if he had spoke
  the wolf would leave his prey
  
    and never fright the silly lamb that day
  
   
   when he beheld his shadow in the brook
  
  the fishes spread on it their golden gills
          1100 
  when he was by
  the birds such pleasure took
  
  that some would sing
  some other in their bills 
    would bring him mulberries and ripe red cherries
  
    he fed them with his sight
  they him with berries
  
   
   but this foul
  grim
  and urchin snouted boar
       1105 
  whose downward eye still looketh for a grave
  
  ne er saw the beauteous livery that he wore
  
  witness the entertainment that he gave
              1108 
    if he did see his face
  why then i know 
    he thought to kiss him
  and hath kill d him so
  
   
    tis true
   tis true
  thus was adonis slain
  
  he ran upon the boar with his sharp spear
           1112 
  who did not whet his teeth at him again
  
  but by a kiss thought to persuade him there
  
    and nuzzling in his flank
  the loving swine 
    sheath d unaware the tusk in his soft groin
       1116 
   
   had i been tooth d like him
  i must confess
  
  with kissing him i should have kill d him first
  
  but he is dead
  and never did he bless 
  my youth with his
  the more am i accurst
            1120 
    with this she falleth in the place she stood
  
    and stains her face with his congealed blood
  
   
  she looks upon his lips
  and they are pale
  
  she takes him by the hand
  and that is cold
         1124 
  she whispers in his ears a heavy tale
  
  as if they heard the woeful words she told
  
  she lifts the coffer lids that close his eyes
  
  where lo
  two lamps burnt out in darkness lies
  
   
  two glasses where herself herself beheld            1129 
  a thousand times
  and now no more reflect
  
  their virtue lost
  wherein they late excell d
  
  and every beauty robb d of his effect
               1132 
     wonder of time
   quoth she
   this is my spite
  
    that thou being dead
  the day should yet be light
  
   
   since thou art dead
  lo here i prophesy
  
  sorrow on love hereafter shall attend
               1136 
  it shall be waited on with jealousy
  
  find sweet beginning
  but unsavoury end
  
    ne er settled equally
  but high or low
  
    that all love s pleasure shall not match his woe
  
   
   it shall be fickle
  false and full of fraud
        1141 
  bud
  and be blasted in a breathing while
  
  the bottom poison
  and the top o erstraw d 
  with sweets that shall the truest sight beguile
     1144 
    the strongest body shall it make most weak
  
    strike the wise dumb
  and teach the fool to speak
  
   
   it shall be sparing
  and too full of riot
  
  teaching decrepit age to tread the measures
         1148 
  the staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet
  
  pluck down the rich
  enrich the poor with treasures
  
    it shall be raging mad
  and silly mild
  
    make the young old
  the old become a child
        1152 
   
   it shall suspect where is no cause of fear
  
  it shall not fear where it should most mistrust
  
  it shall be merciful
  and too severe
  
  and most deceiving when it seems most just
          1156 
    perverse it shall be
  where it shows most toward
  
    put fear to valour
  courage to the coward
  
   
   it shall be cause of war and dire events
  
  and set dissension  twixt the son and sire
          1160 
  subject and servile to all discontents
  
  as dry combustious matter is to fire
  
    sith in his prime death doth my love destroy
  
    they that love best their love shall not enjoy
    1164 
   
  by this the boy that by her side lay kill d 
  was melted like a vapour from her sight
  
  and in his blood that on the ground lay spill d
  
  a purple flower sprung up
  chequer d with white
     1168 
    resembling well his pale cheeks
  and the blood 
    which in round drops upon their whiteness stood
  
   
  she bows her head
  the new sprung flower to smell
  
  comparing it to her adonis  breath
                  1172 
  and says within her bosom it shall dwell
  
  since he himself is reft from her by death
  
    she drops the stalk
  and in the breach appears 
    green dropping sap
  which she compares to tears
  
   
   poor flower
   quoth she
   this was thy father s guise
  
  sweet issue of a more sweet smelling sire
  
  for every little grief to wet his eyes
  
  to grow unto himself was his desire
                 1180 
    and so  tis thine
  but know
  it is as good 
    to wither in my breast as in his blood
  
   
   here was thy father s bed
  here in my breast
  
  thou art the next of blood
  and  tis thy right
      1184 
  lo in this hollow cradle take thy rest
  
  my throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night
  
    there shall not be one minute in an hour 
    wherein i will not kiss my sweet love s flower
   
   
  thus weary of the world
  away she hies
              1189 
  and yokes her silver doves
  by whose swift aid 
  their mistress mounted through the empty skies
  
  in her light chariot quickly is convey d
            1192 
    holding their course to paphos
  where their queen 
    means to immure herself and not be seen
  
      
   
    finis
