 I wol biwaille in manere of tragedie
 The harm of hem that stoode in heigh degree,
 And fillen so that ther nas no remedie
 To brynge hem out of hir adversitee.
 For certein, whan that Fortune list to flee,
 Ther may no man the cours of hire withholde.
 Lat no man truste on blynd prosperitee;
 Be war by thise ensamples trewe and olde.
 At Lucifer, though he an angel were
2000 And nat a man, at hym wol I bigynne.
 For though Fortune may noon angel dere,
 From heigh degree yet fel he for his synne
 Doun into helle, where he yet is inne.
 O Lucifer, brightest of angels alle,
 Now artow Sathanas, that mayst nat twynne
 Out of miserie, in which that thou art falle.
 Loo Adam, in the feeld of Damyssene
 With Goddes owene fynger wroght was he,
 And nat bigeten of mannes sperme unclene,
2010 And welte al paradys savynge o tree.
 Hadde nevere worldly man so heigh degree
 As Adam, til he for mysgovernaunce
 Was dryven out of hys hye prosperitee
 To labour, and to helle, and to meschaunce.
 Loo Sampsoun, which that was annunciat
 By th' angel longe er his nativitee,
 And was to God Almyghty consecrat,
 And stood in noblesse whil he myghte see.
 Was nevere swich another as was hee,
2020 To speke of strengthe, and therwith hardynesse;
 But to his wyves toolde he his secree,
 Thurgh which he slow hymself for wrecchednesse.
 Sampsoun, this noble almyghty champioun,
 Withouten wepen save his handes tweye,
 He slow and al torente the leoun,
 Toward his weddyng walkynge by the weye.
 His false wyf koude hym so plese and preye
 Til she his conseil knew; and she, untrewe,
 Unto his foos his conseil gan biwreye,
2030 And hym forsook, and took another newe.
 Thre hundred foxes took Sampson for ire,
 And alle hir tayles he togydre bond,
 And sette the foxes tayles alle on fire,
 For he on every tayl had knyt a brond;
 And they brende alle the cornes in that lond,
 And alle hire olyveres, and vynes eke.
 A thousand men he slow eek with his hond,
 And hadde no wepen but an asses cheke.
 Whan they were slayn, so thursted hym that he
2040 Was wel ny lorn, for which he gan to preye
 That God wolde on his peyne han some pitee
 And sende hym drynke, or elles moste he deye;
 And of this asses cheke, that was dreye,
 Out of a wang-tooth sprang anon a welle,
 Of which he drank ynogh, shortly to seye;
 Thus heelp hym God, as Judicum can telle.
 By verray force at Gazan on a nyght,
 Maugree Philistiens of that citee,
 The gates of the toun he hath up plyght,
2050 And on his bak ycaryed hem hath hee
 Hye on an hill whereas men myghte hem see.
 O noble, almyghty Sampsoun, lief and deere,
 Had thou nat toold to wommen thy secree,
 In al this world ne hadde been thy peere!
 This Sampson nevere ciser drank ne wyn,
 Ne on his heed cam rasour noon ne sheere,
 By precept of the messager divyn,
 For alle his strengthes in his heeres weere.
 And fully twenty wynter, yeer by yeere,
2060 He hadde of Israel the governaunce.
 But soone shal he wepe many a teere,
 For wommen shal hym bryngen to meschaunce!
 Unto his lemman Dalida he tolde
 That in his heeris al his strengthe lay,
 And falsly to his foomen she hym solde.
 And slepynge in hir barm upon a day,
 She made to clippe or shere his heres away,
 And made his foomen al his craft espyen;
 And whan that they hym foond in this array,
2070 They bounde hym faste and putten out his yen.
 But er his heer were clipped or yshave,
 Ther was no boond with which men myghte him bynde;
 But now is he in prison in a cave,
 Where-as they made hym at the queerne grynde.
 O noble Sampsoun, strongest of mankynde,
 O whilom juge, in glorie and in richesse!
 Now maystow wepen with thyne eyen blynde,
 Sith thou fro wele art falle in wrecchednesse.
 The ende of this caytyf was as I shal seye.
2080 His foomen made a feeste upon a day,
 And made hym as hire fool biforn hem pleye;
 And this was in a temple of greet array.
 But atte laste he made a foul affray,
 For he two pilers shook and made hem falle,
 And doun fil temple and al, and ther it lay --
 And slow hymself, and eek his foomen alle.
 This is to seyn, the prynces everichoon,
 And eek thre thousand bodyes, were ther slayn
 With fallynge of the grete temple of stoon.
2090 Of Sampson now wol I namoore sayn.
 Beth war by this ensample oold and playn
 That no men telle hir conseil til hir wyves
 Of swich thyng as they wolde han secree fayn,
 If that it touche hir lymes or hir lyves.
 Of Hercules, the sovereyn conquerour,
 Syngen his werkes laude and heigh renoun;
 For in his tyme of strengthe he was the flour.
 He slow and rafte the skyn of the leoun;
 He of Centauros leyde the boost adoun;
2100 He Arpies slow, the crueel bryddes felle;
 He golden apples rafte of the dragoun;
 He drow out Cerberus, the hound of helle;
 He slow the crueel tyrant Busirus
 And made his hors to frete hym, flessh and boon;
 He slow the firy serpent venymus;
 Of Acheloys two hornes he brak oon;
 And he slow Cacus in a cave of stoon;
 He slow the geant Antheus the stronge;
 He slow the grisly boor, and that anon;
2110 And bar the hevene on his nekke longe.
 Was nevere wight, sith that this world bigan,
 That slow so manye monstres as dide he.
 Thurghout this wyde world his name ran,
 What for his strengthe and for his heigh bountee,
 And every reawme wente he for to see.
 He was so stroong that no man myghte hym lette.
 At bothe the worldes endes, seith Trophee,
 In stide of boundes he a pileer sette.
 A lemman hadde this noble champioun,
2120 That highte Dianira, fressh as May;
 And as thise clerkes maken mencioun,
 She hath hym sent a sherte, fressh and gay.
 Allas, this sherte -- allas and weylaway! --
 Envenymed was so subtilly withalle
 That er that he had wered it half a day
 It made his flessh al from his bones falle.
 But nathelees somme clerkes hire excusen
 By oon that highte Nessus, that it maked.
 Be as be may, I wol hire noght accusen;
2130 But on his bak this sherte he wered al naked
 Til that his flessh was for the venym blaked.
 And whan he saugh noon oother remedye,
 In hoote coles he hath hymselven raked,
 For with no venym deigned hym to dye.
 Thus starf this worthy, myghty Hercules.
 Lo, who may truste on Fortune any throwe?
 For hym that folweth al this world of prees
 Er he be war is ofte yleyd ful lowe.
 Ful wys is he that kan hymselven knowe!
2140 Beth war, for whan that Fortune list to glose,
 Thanne wayteth she her man to overthrowe
 By swich a wey as he wolde leest suppose.
 The myghty trone, the precious tresor,
 The glorious ceptre, and roial magestee
 That hadde the kyng Nabugodonosor
 With tonge unnethe may discryved bee.
 He twyes wan Jerusalem the citee;
 The vessel of the temple he with hym ladde.
 At Babiloigne was his sovereyn see,
2150 In which his glorie and his delit he hadde.
 The faireste children of the blood roial
 Of Israel he leet do gelde anoon,
 And maked ech of hem to been his thral.
 Amonges othere Daniel was oon,
 That was the wiseste child of everychon,
 For he the dremes of the kyng expowned,
 Whereas in Chaldeye clerk ne was ther noon
 That wiste to what fyn his dremes sowned.
 This proude kyng leet maken a statue of gold,
2160 Sixty cubites long and sevene in brede,
 To which ymage bothe yong and oold
 Comanded he to loute, and have in drede,
 Or in a fourneys, ful of flambes rede,
 He shal be brent that wolde noght obeye.
 But nevere wolde assente to that dede
 Daniel ne his yonge felawes tweye.
 This kyng of kynges proud was and elaat;
 He wende that God, that sit in magestee,
 Ne myghte hym nat bireve of his estaat.
2170 But sodeynly he loste his dignytee,
 And lyk a beest hym semed for to bee,
 And eet hey as an oxe, and lay theroute
 In reyn; with wilde beestes walked hee
 Til certein tyme was ycome aboute.
 And lik an egles fetheres wax his heres;
 His nayles lyk a briddes clawes weere;
 Til God relessed hym a certeyn yeres,
 And yaf hym wit, and thanne with many a teere
 He thanked God, and evere his lyf in feere
2180 Was he to doon amys or moore trespace;
 And til that tyme he leyd was on his beere
 He knew that God was ful of myght and grace.
 His sone, which that highte Balthasar,
 That heeld the regne after his fader day,
 He by his fader koude noght be war,
 For proud he was of herte and of array,
 And eek an ydolastre was he ay.
 His hye estaat assured hym in pryde;
 But Fortune caste hym doun, and ther he lay,
2190 And sodeynly his regne gan divide.
 A feeste he made unto his lordes alle
 Upon a tyme and bad hem blithe bee;
 And thanne his officeres gan he calle:
 "Gooth, bryngeth forth the vesseles," quod he,
 "Whiche that my fader in his prosperitee
 Out of the temple of Jerusalem birafte;
 And to oure hye goddes thanke we
 Of honour that oure eldres with us lafte."
 Hys wyf, his lordes, and his concubynes
2200 Ay dronken, whil hire appetites laste,
 Out of thise noble vessels sondry wynes.
 And on a wal this kyng his eyen caste
 And saugh an hand, armlees, that wroot ful faste,
 For feere of which he quook and siked soore.
 This hand that Balthasar so soore agaste
 Wroot Mane, techel, phares, and namoore.
 In all that land magicien was noon
 That koude expoune what this lettre mente;
 But Daniel expowned it anoon,
2210 And seyde, "Kyng, God to thy fader lente
 Glorie and honour, regne, tresour, rente;
 And he was proud and nothyng God ne dradde,
 And therfore God greet wreche upon hym sente,
 And hym birafte the regne that he hadde.
 "He was out cast of mannes compaignye;
 With asses was his habitacioun,
 And eet hey as a beest in weet and drye
 Til that he knew, by grace and by resoun,
 That God of hevene hath domynacioun
2220 Over every regne and every creature;
 And thanne hadde God of hym compassioun,
 And hym restored his regne and his figure.
 "Eek thou, that art his sone, art proud also,
 And knowest alle thise thynges verraily,
 And art rebel to God, and art his foo.
 Thou drank eek of his vessels boldely;
 Thy wyf eek, and thy wenches, synfully
 Dronke of the same vessels sondry wynys;
 And heryest false goddes cursedly;
2230 Therefore to thee yshapen ful greet pyne ys.
 "This hand was sent from God that on the wal
 Wroot Mane, techel, phares, truste me;
 Thy regne is doon; thou weyest noght at al.
 Dyvyded is thy regne, and it shal be
 To Medes and to Perses yeven," quod he.
 And thilke same nyght this kyng was slawe,
 And Darius occupieth his degree,
 Thogh he therto hadde neither right ne lawe.
 Lordynges, ensample heerby may ye take
2240 How that in lordshipe is no sikernesse,
 For whan Fortune wole a man forsake,
 She bereth awey his regne and his richesse,
 And eek his freendes, bothe moore and lesse.
 For what man that hath freendes thurgh Fortune,
 Mishap wol maken hem enemys, I gesse;
 This proverbe is ful sooth and ful commune.
 Cenobia, of Palymerie queene,
 As writen Persiens of hir noblesse,
 So worthy was in armes and so keene
2250 That no wight passed hire in hardynesse,
 Ne in lynage, ne in oother gentillesse.
 Of kynges blood of Perce is she descended.
 I seye nat that she hadde moost fairnesse,
 But of hir shap she myghte nat been amended.
 From hire childhede I fynde that she fledde
 Office of wommen, and to wode she wente,
 And many a wilde hertes blood she shedde
 With arwes brode that she to hem sente.
 She was so swift that she anon hem hente;
2260 And whan that she was elder, she wolde kille
 Leouns, leopardes, and beres al torente,
 And in hir armes weelde hem at hir wille.
 She dorste wilde beestes dennes seke,
 And rennen in the montaignes al the nyght,
 And slepen under a bussh, and she koude eke
 Wrastlen, by verray force and verray myght,
 With any yong man, were he never so wight.
 Ther myghte no thyng in hir armes stonde.
 She kepte hir maydenhod from every wight;
2270 To no man deigned hire for to be bonde.
 But atte laste hir freendes han hire maried
 To Odenake, a prynce of that contree,
 Al were it so that she hem longe taried.
 And ye shul understonde how that he
 Hadde swiche fantasies as hadde she.
 But natheless, whan they were knyt in-feere,
 They lyved in joye and in felicitee,
 For ech of hem hadde oother lief and deere,
 Save o thyng: that she wolde nevere assente,
2280 By no wey, that he sholde by hire lye
 But ones, for it was hir pleyn entente
 To have a child, the world to multiplye;
 And also soone as that she myghte espye
 That she was nat with childe with that dede,
 Thanne wolde she suffre hym doon his fantasye
 Eft-soone, and nat but oones, out of drede.
 And if she were with childe at thilke cast,
 Namoore sholde he pleyen thilke game
 Til fully fourty [wikes] weren past;
2290 Thanne wolde she ones suffre hym do the same.
 Al were this Odenake wilde or tame,
 He gat namoore of hire, for thus she seyde:
 It was to wyves lecherie and shame,
 In oother caas, if that men with hem pleyde.
 Two sones by this Odenake hadde she,
 The whiche she kepte in vertu and lettrure.
 But now unto oure tale turne we.
 I seye, so worshipful a creature,
 And wys therwith, and large with mesure,
2300 So penyble in the werre, and curteis eke,
 Ne moore labour myghte in werre endure,
 Was noon, though al this world men sholde seke.
 Hir riche array ne myghte nat be told,
 As wel in vessel as in hire clothyng.
 She was al clad in perree and in gold,
 And eek she lafte noght, for noon huntyng,
 To have of sondry tonges ful knowyng,
 Whan that she leyser hadde; and for to entende
 To lerne bookes was al hire likyng,
2310 How she in vertu myghte hir lyf dispende.
 And shortly of this storie for to trete,
 So doghty was hir housbonde and eek she,
 That they conquered manye regnes grete
 In the orient, with many a fair citee
 Apertenaunt unto the magestee
 Of Rome, and with strong hond held hem ful faste,
 Ne nevere myghte hir foomen doon hem flee,
 Ay whil that Odenakes dayes laste.
 Hir batailles, whoso list hem for to rede,
2320 Agayn Sapor the kyng and othere mo,
 And how that al this proces fil in dede,
 Why she conquered and what title had therto,
 And after, of hir meschief and hire wo,
 How that she was biseged and ytake --
 Lat hym unto my maister Petrak go,
 That writ ynough of this, I undertake.
 Whan Odenake was deed, she myghtily
 The regnes heeld, and with hire propre hond
 Agayn hir foos she faught so cruelly
2330 That ther nas kyng ne prynce in al that lond
 That he nas glad, if he that grace fond,
 That she ne wolde upon his lond werreye.
 With hire they maden alliance by bond
 To been in pees, and lete hire ride and pleye.
 The Emperour of Rome, Claudius
 Ne hym bifore, the Romayn Galien,
 Ne dorste nevere been so corageus,
 Ne noon Ermyn, ne noon Egipcien,
 Ne Surrien, ne noon Arabyen,
2340 Withinne the feeld that dorste with hire fighte,
 Lest that she wolde hem with hir handes slen,
 Or with hir meignee putten hem to flighte.
 In kynges habit wente hir sones two,
 As heires of hir fadres regnes alle,
 And Hermanno and Thymalao
 Hir names were, as Persiens hem calle.
 But ay Fortune hath in hire hony galle;
 This myghty queene may no while endure.
 Fortune out of hir regne made hire falle
2350 To wrecchednesse and to mysaventure.
 Aurelian, whan that the governaunce
 Of Rome cam into his handes tweye,
 He shoop upon this queene to doon vengeaunce.
 And with his legions he took his weye
 Toward Cenobie, and shortly for to seye,
 He made hire flee, and atte laste hire hente,
 And fettred hire, and eek hire children tweye,
 And wan the land, and hoom to Rome he wente.
 Amonges othere thynges that he wan,
2360 Hir chaar, that was with gold wroght and perree,
 This grete Romayn, this Aurelian,
 Hath with hym lad, for that men sholde it see.
 Biforen his triumphe walketh shee,
 With gilte cheynes on hire nekke hangynge.
 Coroned was she, as after hir degree,
 And ful of perree charged hire clothynge.
 Allas, Fortune! She that whilom was
 Dredeful to kynges and to emperoures,
 Now gaureth al the peple on hire, allas!
2370 And she that helmed was in starke stoures
 And wan by force townes stronge and toures,
 Shal on hir heed now were a vitremyte;
 And she that bar the ceptre ful of floures
 Shal bere a distaf, hire cost for to quyte.
 O noble, O worthy Petro, glorie of Spayne,
 Whom Fortune heeld so hye in magestee,
 Wel oghten men thy pitous deeth complayne!
 Out of thy land thy brother made thee flee,
 And after, at a seege, by subtiltee,
2380 Thou were bitraysed and lad unto his tente,
 Where as he with his owene hand slow thee,
 Succedynge in thy regne and in thy rente.
 The feeld of snow, with th' egle of blak therinne,
 Caught with the lymrod coloured as the gleede,
 He brew this cursednesse and al this synne.
 The wikked nest was werker of this nede.
 Noght Charles Olyver, that took ay heede
 Of trouthe and honour, but of Armorike
 Genylon-Olyver, corrupt for meede,
2390 Broghte this worthy kyng in swich a brike.
 O worthy Petro, kyng of Cipre, also,
 That Alisandre wan by heigh maistrie,
 Ful many an hethen wroghtestow ful wo,
 Of which thyne owene liges hadde envie,
 And for no thyng but for thy chivalrie
 They in thy bed han slayn thee by the morwe.
 Thus kan Fortune hir wheel governe and gye,
 And out of joye brynge men to sorwe.
 Off Melan grete Barnabo Viscounte,
2400 God of delit and scourge of Lumbardye,
 Why sholde I nat thyn infortune acounte,
 Sith in estaat thow cloumbe were so hye?
 Thy brother sone, that was thy double allye,
 For he thy nevew was and sone-in-lawe,
 Withinne his prisoun made thee to dye --
 But why ne how noot I that thou were slawe.
 Off the Erl Hugelyn of Pyze the langour
 Ther may no tonge telle for pitee.
 But litel out of Pize stant a tour,
2410 In which tour in prisoun put was he,
 And with hym been his litel children thre;
 The eldest scarsly fyf yeer was of age.
 Allas, Fortune, it was greet crueltee
 Swiche briddes for to putte in swich a cage!
 Dampned was he to dyen in that prisoun,
 For Roger, which that bisshop was of Pize,
 Hadde on hym maad a fals suggestioun,
 Thurgh which the peple gan upon hym rise
 And putten hym to prisoun in swich wise
2420 As ye han herd, and mete and drynke he hadde
 So smal that wel unnethe it may suffise,
 And therwithal it was ful povre and badde.
 And on a day bifil that in that hour
 Whan that his mete wont was to be broght,
 The gayler shette the dores of the tour.
 He herde it wel, but he spak right noght,
 And in his herte anon ther fil a thoght
 That they for hunger wolde doon hym dyen.
 "Allas!" quod he, "Allas, that I was wroght!"
2430 Therwith the teeris fillen from his yen.
 His yonge sone, that thre yeer was of age,
 Unto hym seyde, "Fader, why do ye wepe?
 Whanne wol the gayler bryngen oure potage?
 Is ther no morsel breed that ye do kepe?
 I am so hungry that I may nat slepe.
 Now wolde God that I myghte slepen evere!
 Thanne sholde nat hunger in my wombe crepe;
 Ther is no thyng, but breed, that me were levere."
 Thus day by day this child bigan to crye,
2440 Til in his fadres barm adoun it lay,
 And seyde, "Farewel, fader, I moot dye!"
 And kiste his fader, and dyde the same day.
 And whan the woful fader deed it say,
 For wo his armes two he gan to byte,
 And seyde, "Allas, Fortune, and weylaway!
 Thy false wheel my wo al may I wyte."
 His children wende that it for hunger was
 That he his armes gnow, and nat for wo,
 And seyde, "Fader, do nat so, allas!
2450 But rather ete the flessh upon us two.
 Oure flessh thou yaf us, take oure flessh us fro,
 And ete ynogh" -- right thus they to hym seyde,
 And after that, withinne a day or two,
 They leyde hem in his lappe adoun and deyde.
 Hymself, despeired, eek for hunger starf;
 Thus ended is this myghty Erl of Pize.
 From heigh estaat Fortune awey hym carf.
 Of this tragedie it oghte ynough suffise;
 Whoso wol here it in a lenger wise,
2460 Redeth the grete poete of Ytaille
 That highte Dant, for he kan al devyse
 Fro point to point; nat o word wol he faille.
 Although that Nero were as vicius
 As any feend that lith ful lowe adoun,
 Yet he, as telleth us Swetonius,
 This wyde world hadde in subjeccioun,
 Bothe est and west, [south], and septemtrioun.
 Of rubies, saphires, and of peerles white
 Were alle his clothes brouded up and doun,
2470 For he in gemmes greetly gan delite.
 Moore delicaat, moore pompous of array,
 Moore proud was nevere emperour than he;
 That ilke clooth that he hadde wered o day,
 After that tyme he nolde it nevere see.
 Nettes of gold threed hadde he greet plentee
 To fisshe in Tybre, whan hym liste pleye.
 His lustes were al lawe in his decree,
 For Fortune as his freend hym wolde obeye.
 He Rome brende for his delicasie;
2480 The senatours he slow upon a day
 To heere how that men wolde wepe and crie;
 And slow his brother, and by his suster lay.
 His mooder made he in pitous array,
 For he hire wombe slitte to biholde
 Where he conceyved was -- so weilaway
 That he so litel of his mooder tolde!
 No teere out of his eyen for that sighte
 Ne cam, but seyde, "A fair womman was she!"
 Greet wonder is how that he koude or myghte
2490 Be domesman of hire dede beautee.
 The wyn to bryngen hym comanded he,
 And drank anon -- noon oother wo he made.
 Whan myght is joyned unto crueltee,
 Allas, to depe wol the venym wade!
 In yowthe a maister hadde this emperour
 To teche hym letterure and curteisye,
 For of moralitee he was the flour,
 As in his tyme, but if bookes lye;
 And whil this maister hadde of hym maistrye,
2500 He maked hym so konnyng and so sowple
 That longe tyme it was er tirannye
 Or any vice dorste on hym uncowple.
 This Seneca, of which that I devyse,
 By cause Nero hadde of hym swich drede,
 For he fro vices wolde hym ay chastise
 Discreetly, as by word and nat by dede --
 "Sire," wolde he seyn, "an emperour moot nede
 Be vertuous and hate tirannye --"
 For which he in a bath made hym to blede
2510 On bothe his armes, til he moste dye.
 This Nero hadde eek of acustumaunce
 In youthe agayns his maister for to ryse,
 Which afterward hym thoughte a greet grevaunce;
 Therefore he made hym dyen in this wise.
 But natheless this Seneca the wise
 Chees in a bath to dye in this manere
 Rather than han another tormentise;
 And thus hath Nero slayn his maister deere.
 Now fil it so that Fortune liste no lenger
2520 The hye pryde of Nero to cherice,
 For though that he were strong, yet was she strenger.
 She thoughte thus: "By God! I am to nyce
 To sette a man that is fulfild of vice
 In heigh degree, and emperour hym calle.
 By God, out of his sete I wol hym trice;
 Whan he leest weneth, sonnest shal he falle."
 The peple roos upon hym on a nyght
 For his defaute, and whan he it espied,
 Out of his dores anon he hath hym dight
2530 Allone, and ther he wende han been allied
 He knokked faste, and ay the moore he cried
 The fastere shette they the dores alle.
 Tho wiste he wel, he hadde himself mysgyed,
 And wente his wey; no lenger dorste he calle.
 The peple cried and rombled up and doun,
 That with his erys herde he how they seyde,
 "Where is this false tiraunt, this Neroun?"
 For fere almoost out of his wit he breyde,
 And to his goddes pitously he preyde
2540 For socour, but it myghte nat bityde.
 For drede of this hym thoughte that he deyde,
 And ran into a gardyn hym to hyde.
 And in this gardyn foond he cherles tweye
 That seten by a fyr, greet and reed.
 And to thise cherles two he gan to preye
 To sleen hym and to girden of his heed,
 That to his body, whan that he were deed,
 Were no despit ydoon for his defame.
 Hymself he slow, he koude no bettre reed,
2550 Of which Fortune lough, and hadde a game.
 Was nevere capitayn under a kyng
 That regnes mo putte in subjeccioun,
 Ne strenger was in feeld of alle thyng,
 As in his tyme, ne gretter of renoun,
 Ne moore pompous in heigh presumpcioun
 Than Oloferne, which Fortune ay kiste
 So likerously, and ladde hym up and doun
 Til that his heed was of, er that he wiste.
 Nat oonly that this world hadde hym in awe
2560 For lesynge of richesse or libertee,
 But he made every man reneyen his lawe.
 "Nabugodonosor was god," seyde hee;
 "Noon oother god sholde adoured bee."
 Agayns his heeste no wight dorst trespace,
 Save in Bethulia, a strong citee,
 Where Eliachim a preest was of that place.
 But taak kep of the deth of Oloferne:
 Amydde his hoost he dronke lay a-nyght,
 Withinne his tente, large as is a berne,
2570 And yet, for al his pompe and al his myght,
 Judith, a womman, as he lay upright
 Slepynge, his heed of smoot, and from his tente
 Ful pryvely she stal from every wight,
 And with his heed unto hir toun she wente.
 What nedeth it of kyng Anthiochus
 To telle his hye roial magestee,
 His hye pride, his werkes venymus?
 For swich another was ther noon as he.
 Rede which that he was in Machabee,
2580 And rede the proude wordes that he seyde,
 And why he fil fro heigh prosperitee,
 And in an hill how wrecchedly he deyde.
 Fortune hym hadde enhaunced so in pride
 That verraily he wende he myghte attayne
 Unto the sterres upon every syde,
 And in balance weyen ech montayne,
 And alle the floodes of the see restrayne.
 And Goddes peple hadde he moost in hate;
 Hem wolde he sleen in torment and in payne,
2590 Wenynge that God ne myghte his pride abate.
 And for that Nichanore and Thymothee
 Of Jewes weren venquysshed myghtily,
 Unto the Jewes swich an hate hadde he
 That he bad greithen his chaar ful hastily,
 And swoor, and seyde ful despitously
 Unto Jerusalem he wolde eftsoone
 To wreken his ire on it ful cruelly;
 But of his purpos he was let ful soone.
 God for his manace hym so soore smoot
2600 With invisible wounde, ay incurable,
 That in his guttes carf it so and boot
 That his peynes weren importable.
 And certeinly the wreche was resonable,
 For many a mannes guttes dide he peyne.
 But from his purpos cursed and dampnable,
 For al his smert, he wolde hym nat restreyne,
 But bad anon apparaillen his hoost;
 And sodeynly, er he was of it war,
 God daunted al his pride and al his boost.
2610 For he so soore fil out of his char
 That it his limes and his skyn totar,
 So that he neyther myghte go ne ryde,
 But in a chayer men aboute hym bar,
 Al forbrused, bothe bak and syde.
 The wreche of God hym smoot so cruelly
 That thurgh his body wikked wormes crepte,
 And therwithal he stank so horribly
 That noon of al his meynee that hym kepte,
 Wheither so he wook or ellis slepte,
2620 Ne myghte noght the stynk of hym endure.
 In this meschief he wayled and eek wepte,
 And knew God lord of every creature.
 To al his hoost and to hymself also
 Ful wlatsom was the stynk of his careyne;
 No man ne myghte hym bere to ne fro.
 And in this stynk and this horrible peyne,
 He starf ful wrecchedly in a monteyne.
 Thus hath this robbour and this homycide,
 That many a man made to wepe and pleyne,
2630 Swich gerdoun as bilongeth unto pryde.
 The storie of Alisaundre is so commune
 That every wight that hath discrecioun
 Hath herd somwhat or al of his fortune.
 This wyde world, as in conclusioun,
 He wan by strengthe, or for his hye renoun
 They weren glad for pees unto hym sende.
 The pride of man and beest he leyde adoun,
 Wherso he cam, unto the worldes ende.
 Comparisoun myghte nevere yet been maked
2640 Bitwixe hym and another conquerour;
 For al this world for drede of hym hath quaked.
 He was of knyghthod and of fredom flour;
 Fortune hym made the heir of hire honour.
 Save wyn and wommen, no thing myghte aswage
 His hye entente in armes and labour,
 So was he ful of leonyn corage.
 What pris were it to hym, though I yow tolde
 Of Darius, and an hundred thousand mo
 Of kynges, princes, dukes, erles bolde
2650 Whiche he conquered, and broghte hem into wo?
 I seye, as fer as man may ryde or go,
 The world was his -- what sholde I moore devyse?
 For though I write or tolde yow everemo
 Of his knyghthod, it myghte nat suffise.
 Twelf yeer he regned, as seith Machabee.
 Philippes sone of Macidoyne he was,
 That first was kyng in Grece the contree.
 O worthy, gentil Alisandre, allas,
 That evere sholde fallen swich a cas!
2660 Empoysoned of thyn owene folk thou weere;
 Thy sys Fortune hath turned into aas,
 And for thee ne weep she never a teere.
 Who shal me yeven teeris to compleyne
 The deeth of gentillesse and of franchise,
 That al the world weelded in his demeyne,
 And yet hym thoughte it myghte nat suffise?
 So ful was his corage of heigh emprise.
 Allas, who shal me helpe to endite
 False Fortune, and poyson to despise,
2670 The whiche two of al this wo I wyte?
 By wisedom, manhede, and by greet labour,
 From humble bed to roial magestee
 Up roos he Julius, the conquerour,
 That wan al th' occident by land and see,
 By strengthe of hand, or elles by tretee,
 And unto Rome made hem tributarie;
 And sitthe of Rome the emperour was he
 Til that Fortune weex his adversarie.
 O myghty Cesar, that in Thessalie
2680 Agayn Pompeus, fader thyn in lawe,
 That of the orient hadde al the chivalrie
 As fer as that the day bigynneth dawe,
 Thou thurgh thy knyghthod hast hem take and slawe,
 Save fewe folk that with Pompeus fledde,
 Thurgh which thou puttest al th' orient in awe.
 Thanke Fortune, that so wel thee spedde!
 But now a litel while I wol biwaille
 This Pompeus, this noble governour
 Of Rome, which that fleigh at this bataille.
2690 I seye, oon of his men, a fals traitour,
 His heed of smoot, to wynnen hym favour
 Of Julius, and hym the heed he broghte.
 Allas, Pompeye, of th' orient conquerour,
 That Fortune unto swich a fyn thee broghte!
 To Rome agayn repaireth Julius
 With his triumphe, lauriat ful hye;
 But on a tyme Brutus Cassius,
 That evere hadde of his hye estaat envye,
 Ful prively hath maad conspiracye
2700 Agayns this Julius in subtil wise,
 And caste the place in which he sholde dye
 With boydekyns, as I shal yow devyse.
 This Julius to the Capitolie wente
 Upon a day, as he was wont to goon,
 And in the Capitolie anon hym hente
 This false Brutus and his othere foon,
 And stiked hym with boydekyns anoon
 With many a wounde, and thus they lete hym lye;
 But nevere gronte he at no strook but oon,
2710 Or elles at two, but if his storie lye.
 So manly was this Julius of herte,
 And so wel lovede estaatly honestee,
 That though his deedly woundes soore smerte,
 His mantel over his hypes caste he,
 For no man sholde seen his privetee;
 And as he lay of diyng in a traunce,
 And wiste verraily that deed was hee,
 Of honestee yet hadde he remembraunce.
 Lucan, to thee this storie I recomende,
2720 And to Swetoun, and to Valerius also,
 That of this storie writen word and ende,
 How that to thise grete conqueroures two
 Fortune was first freend, and sitthe foo.
 No man ne truste upon hire favour longe,
 But have hire in awayt for everemoo;
 Witnesse on alle thise conqueroures stronge.
 This riche Cresus, whilom kyng of Lyde,
 Of which Cresus Cirus soore hym dradde,
 Yet was he caught amyddes al his pryde,
2730 And to be brent men to the fyr hym ladde.
 But swich a reyn doun fro the welkne shadde
 That slow the fyr, and made hym to escape;
 But to be war no grace yet he hadde,
 Til Fortune on the galwes made hym gape.
 Whanne he escaped was, he kan nat stente
 For to bigynne a newe werre agayn.
 He wende wel, for that Fortune hym sente
 Swich hap that he escaped thurgh the rayn,
 That of his foos he myghte nat be slayn;
2740 And eek a sweven upon a nyght he mette,
 Of which he was so proud and eek so fayn
 That in vengeance he al his herte sette.
 Upon a tree he was, as that hym thoughte,
 Ther Juppiter hym wessh, bothe bak and syde,
 And Phebus eek a fair towaille hym broughte
 To dryen hym with; and therfore wax his pryde,
 And to his doghter, that stood hym bisyde,
 Which that he knew in heigh sentence habounde,
 He bad hire telle hym what it signyfyde,
2750 And she his dreem bigan right thus expounde:
 "The tree," quod she, "the galwes is to meene,
 And Juppiter bitokneth snow and reyn,
 And Phebus, with his towaille so clene,
 Tho been the sonne stremes for to seyn.
 Thou shalt anhanged be, fader, certeyn;
 Reyn shal thee wasshe, and sonne shal thee drye."
 Thus warned hym ful plat and ek ful pleyn
 His doghter, which that called was Phanye.
 Anhanged was Cresus, the proude kyng;
2760 His roial trone myghte hym nat availle.
 Tragedies noon oother maner thyng
 Ne kan in syngyng crie ne biwaille
 But that Fortune alwey wole assaille
 With unwar strook the regnes that been proude;
 For whan men trusteth hire, thanne wol she faille,
 And covere hire brighte face with a clowde.
