 "Hoo!" quod the Knyght, "good sire, namoore of this!
 That ye han seyd is right ynough, ywis,
 And muchel moore; for litel hevynesse
2770 Is right ynough to muche folk, I gesse.
 I seye for me, it is a greet disese,
 Whereas men han been in greet welthe and ese,
 To heeren of hire sodeyn fal, allas!
 And the contrarie is joye and greet solas,
 As whan a man hath been in povre estaat,
 And clymbeth up and wexeth fortunat,
 And there abideth in prosperitee.
 Swich thyng is gladsom, as it thynketh me,
 And of swich thyng were goodly for to telle."
2780 "Ye," quod oure Hooste, "by Seint Poules belle!
 Ye seye right sooth; this Monk he clappeth lowde.
 He spak how Fortune covered with a clowde
 I noot nevere what; and als of a tragedie
 Right now ye herde, and pardee, no remedie
 It is for to biwaille ne compleyne
 That that is doon, and als it is a peyne,
 As ye han seyd, to heere of hevynesse.
 "Sire Monk, namoore of this, so God yow blesse!
 Youre tale anoyeth al this compaignye.
2790 Swich talkyng is nat worth a boterflye,
 For therinne is ther no desport ne game.
 Wherfore, sire Monk, daun Piers by youre name,
 I pray yow hertely telle us somwhat elles;
 For sikerly, nere clynkyng of youre belles
 That on youre bridel hange on every syde,
 By hevene kyng that for us alle dyde,
 I sholde er this han fallen doun for sleep,
 Althogh the slough had never been so deep;
 Thanne hadde your tale al be toold in veyn.
2800 For certeinly, as that thise clerkes seyn,
 Whereas a man may have noon audience,
 Noght helpeth it to tellen his sentence.
 "And wel I woot the substance is in me,
 If any thyng shal wel reported be.
 Sir, sey somwhat of huntyng, I yow preye."
 "Nay," quod this Monk, "I have no lust to pleye.
 Now lat another telle, as I have toold."
 Thanne spak oure Hoost with rude speche and boold,
 And seyde unto the Nonnes Preest anon,
2810 "Com neer, thou preest, com hyder, thou sir John!
 Telle us swich thyng as may oure hertes glade.
 Be blithe, though thou ryde upon a jade.
 What thogh thyn hors be bothe foul and lene?
 If he wol serve thee, rekke nat a bene.
 Looke that thyn herte be murie everemo."
 "Yis, sir," quod he, "yis, Hoost, so moot I go,
 But I be myrie, ywis I wol be blamed."
 And right anon his tale he hath attamed,
 And thus he seyde unto us everichon,
2820 This sweete preest, this goodly man sir John.
