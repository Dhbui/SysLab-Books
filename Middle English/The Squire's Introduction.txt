 "Squier, com neer, if it youre wille be,
 And sey somwhat of love, for certes ye
 Konnen theron as muche as any man."
 "Nay, sire," quod he, "but I wol seye as I kan
 With hertly wyl, for I wol nat rebelle
 Agayn youre lust; a tale wol I telle.
 Have me excused if I speke amys;
 My wyl is good, and lo, my tale is this."
