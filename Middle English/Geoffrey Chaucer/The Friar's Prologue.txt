 This worthy lymytour, this noble Frere,
 He made alwey a maner louryng chiere
 Upon the Somonour, but for honestee
 No vileyns word as yet to hym spak he.
 But atte laste he seyde unto the wyf,
1270 Dame, quod he, God yeve yow right good lyf!
 Ye han heer touched, also moot I thee,
 In scole-matere greet difficultee.
 Ye han seyd muche thyng right wel, I seye;
 But, dame, heere as we ryde by the weye,
 Us nedeth nat to speken but of game,
 And lete auctoritees, on Goddes name,
 To prechyng and to scoles of clergye.
 But if it lyke to this compaignye,
 I wol yow of a somonour telle a game.
1280 Pardee, ye may wel knowe by the name
 That of a somonour may no good be sayd;
 I praye that noon of you be yvele apayd.
 A somonour is a rennere up and doun
 With mandementz for fornicacioun,
 And is ybet at every townes ende.
 Oure Hoost tho spak, A, sire, ye sholde be hende
 And curteys, as a man of youre estaat;
 In compaignye we wol have no debaat.
 Telleth youre tale, and lat the Somonour be.
1290 Nay, quod the Somonour, lat hym seye to me
 What so hym list; whan it comth to my lot,
 By God, I shal hym quiten every grot.
 I shal hym tellen which a greet honour
 It is to be a flaterynge lymytour,
 And of many another manere cryme
 Which nedeth nat rehercen at this tyme;
 And his office I shal hym telle, ywis.
 Oure Hoost answerde, Pees, namoore of this!
 And after this he seyde unto the Frere,
1300 Tel forth youre tale, leeve maister deere.
