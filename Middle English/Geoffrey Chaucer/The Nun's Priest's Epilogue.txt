 ["Sire Nonnes Preest," oure Hooste seide anoon,
 "I-blessed be thy breche, and every stoon!
 This was a murie tale of Chauntecleer.
3450 But by my trouthe, if thou were seculer,
 Thou woldest ben a trede-foul aright.
 For if thou have corage as thou hast myght,
 Thee were nede of hennes, as I wene,
 Ya, moo than seven tymes seventene.
 See, whiche braunes hath this gentil preest,
 So gret a nekke, and swich a large breest!
 He loketh as a sperhauk with his yen;
 Him nedeth nat his colour for to dyen
 With brasile ne with greyn of Portyngale.
3460 Now, sire, faire falle yow for youre tale!"
 And after that he, with ful merie chere,
 Seide unto another, as ye shuln heere.]
